	<answer epoch="1403244275000">Shadowgirl is correct . You do n't need a fancy spell to do magic . You can use a red candle , maybe cinnamon scented , to help direct your will , but that 's optional . If you want something enough , you can direct energy into making it happen . You do n't have to wait until he 's asleep . You can make this wish and visualization before you go to sleep . Then you might even dreamwalk to him -LRB- enter his dreams -RRB- . Be warned , however . Doing this stuff is like trying to put a love spell on him , which is usually a bad idea . On the one hand , love spells try to coerce someone into doing something they would n't do naturally , so that can bring bad karma and come back to bite you . I do n't really believe in the 3-fold rule , because I 'm not Wiccan , but I do believe in karma . On the other hand , love spells often work more strongly on the caster than they do on the person you 're trying to cast them on . You could end up obsessing on him even more and making yourself miserable over him . It 's probably wiser to pray for guidence and ask for the love that 's meant to come to you . If he 's older and has a girlfriend already , maybe you 're not meant to be with him . Finally , my belief about love spells is that no matter how much people warn not to do them , people will do them anyway . I also think the consequences of putting a love spell on someone is one of those lessons people have to learn for themselves . It 's like touching a hot stove and getting burned . The lesson sticks better if they do it , rather than having someone warn them not to do it . Do it if you want to , but do n't be surprised if it does n't work out so happily for you in the end . Edit added 2\/29\/08 It 's not technically a love spell to try to dreamwalk to someone or to try to send them a message in dream , but when you want something this much , the energy you put into making it happen works the same way as a spell does . I know because I 've done this kind of thing myself . As I said above , some lessons are only learned from experience . For help in learning how to dreamwalk , see my answer to this question : - Persephone . \*\*\* : D</answer><suggestions>dreamwalk/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1401920867000">It sounds like you 're experiencing these problems using Yahoo/ORGANIZATION Mail because you are experiencing one of two issues with Internet Explorer : either you are using an out-dated version of IE , or IE is set to display Yahoo/ORGANIZATION Mail in `` Compatibility Mode '' . If you are using a version of Internet Explorer less than version 9 , we recommend upgrading to the newest version available for your system . If you 're unsure how to do this , you should have a look at Microsoft 's IE support site at : http:\/\/windows.microsoft.com\/en-US\/internet-explorer\/internet-explorer-help If you are using a new version of Internet Explorer , but still getting this behavior then Compatibility Mode is enabled . You can find out more about this - including how to disable Compatibility View - in the Yahoo/ORGANIZATION Help article `` Fix problems caused by Internet Explorer 's Compatibility View '' , available at : https:\/\/help.yahoo.com\/kb\/SLN22736.html I hope this has helped you !</answer><suggestions>yahoo/ORGANIZATION yahoo/ORGANIZATION microsoft/ORGANIZATION yahoo/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<title>Why are people on Y\/A denying the fact that most white girls prefer white guys over other races of guys ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>If that was so then why are more than 90 % white women cohabitating with white men and about 95-97 % of all married white women married to a white spouse . You will probably say demographics . Well look at big multicultural cities like Toronto/LOCATION , New/LOCATION York/LOCATION , Vancouver/LOCATION , London/LOCATION , Paris/LOCATION , LA./LOCATION . Why do you see more than 80 % whites with whites ? If white girls do not prefer white guys -LRB- and do n't care about skin color at all -RRB- why are A OVERWHELMING MAJORITY -LRB- because that is what 80 % are -RRB- of them with white guys ? And for those white girls that post in here saying they have no preference . Hun/PERSON , you are only one white girl . There are other millions out there . I doubt even 0,01 % of the white girls in the world are on Y\/A so even if all the white girls in here would type they do n't prefer white guys , statistics prove otherwise .</content><suggestions>toronto/LOCATION new/LOCATION york/LOCATION vancouver/LOCATION london/LOCATION paris/LOCATION la./LOCATION hun/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403245143000">How 'd it get there</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403245279000">Go to the doctor ! Tick 's release a poison into the body once attached . It is on a sensitive place on your body and you need treatment IMMEDIATELY . Mikayla/PERSON - LOL</answer><suggestions>mikayla/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403254190000">Check your body carefully . Young ticks -LRB- called nymphs -RRB- are about the size of a poppy seed , so they are difficult to spot . These are the types of ticks most likely to give you an infection . Adult ticks are easier to spot , as they are bigger , and may reach the size of a coffee bean during their feed . Grip the tick with fine-tipped tweezers as close to your skin as possible . This makes it less likely you will crush the tick 's body , which might release bacteria . Pull the tick gently but firmly off your skin . Wipe the area with an antiseptic .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
