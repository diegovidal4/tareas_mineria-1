	<content>I used clear nail polish on my phone case so the paint would n't chip . But when I applied it , it was sticky and a bit bumpy . Will it dry sticky too ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402798910000">It might not be sticky but it will most likely dry with some bumps on it . it 's like if you do a clear coat of nail polish on your nails and if it comes out looking bumpy when you apply it , it drys a bit bumpy . If the polish does n't end well on your phone , just put A LITTLE BIT of nail polish remover on a cotton ball and gently rub it over the place you put the polish . Do n't drench the cotton ball or you could possibly ruin your phone .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Is lemon with facial cleanser good for acne treatment ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Like teenagers normally do , I have acne problems and its getting on my nerves . So a couple days ago a girl from my class told me I could try putting lemon with my facial cleanser and it 'll get rid of the acne . She told me she tried it with one of her friends and that person now has really clear skin . However , school is over now cause next week is regents week and I 'm not so sure about some things and I ca n't ask her . So I was wondering how much lemon I should put , how long I leave it there for and what specific brands of cleanser . Also I 'm wondering if you guys think putting it in the cleanser is better or just using it with water . Thanks .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402713443000">yes</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402741251000">The only acne treatment that I 've seen work every time goes like this : 1 - Wet one clean washcloth -LRB- or something similar -RRB- in hot water , and another in icy water . Press the hot cloth to your face , particularly the areas with the breakouts , for about one minute . Then switch to the cold cloth and do the same thing . Alternate between the two about five times each . Acne is , in it 's simplest form , pores that have been clogged with dirt , sweat , oil , ect . The trick to this treatment is that the warm cloth makes your pores open , and the cold cloth shuts then . The repeated opening and shutting action essentially squeezes any and all acne-causing grime out of your pores . You will see a noticable improvement in your acne the next day if you do it right , and regular use of this treatment will clean your skin . I 'm usually not this sure about things like this , but there is no reason why this should n't work unless you do it wrong . Be sure to keep the hot cloth hot amd the cold cloth cold and you shouldd he okay , though . Good luck 2 - Use arganlife acne treatment oil it works great also . https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=YNSvzxDN15E</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402996964000">Are you sure you want to do this by yourself if you do n't even know if your hair is supposed to be dry ? Not trying to be rude ... but you will need to lighten your hair to the color inside a banana to get it the correct shade of blue . Even a hint of yellow and it 'll look doodoo green . Yellow + blue = green . Also box color is really difficult to remove from hair so it will be a brassy orange until you bleach it quite a few times so that will be VERY damaged . I suggest you cut a little bit of hair out , bleach it , , time it and see how long it takes , what color it gets , wash that out then apply the blue you want . It 's better to test on a strand then to give it a whirl on your whole head . Goodluck to you !!</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<content>my aunt told me she would me stay with her for the summer i want go go by July 17th i just stopped biting my nails . if my nails are longer she will let me stay with her . i 'm a ten year old afro-american girl please help . thanks in advance</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402985664000">I 'm able to grow my nails out really long in just a few weeks , so I hope these solutions help . Try and eat more vegetables and fruits . Sleep a little longer . Relax , spend some alone time with yourself if that 's what you prefer to do rather then be around people . Trim your nails to an even length , or have a parent or guardian do it for you . Once you 've done that , all your nails can start growing at an even length . Keep dirt out of your nails . Whenever you feel the urge to bite your nails , Try and keep them occupied . Or put your hands under your legs as you sit . Put lotion on your hands and keep them from getting dried out . Hope this helped ! c : My nails grow really long , really fast . .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>I 'm going to try to make a dress and I need help !!?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So , I am a huge fan of the dress Blair/PERSON Waldorf/PERSON wore for her senior prom in Gossip Girl . I want it for my senior prom , but I ca n't find anywhere to buy it . So I decided I might try to make it . Would it be really hard ? Where could I get the material for the bottom half and for the top half ? Also , the gold part , what would that be called ... gold lace maybe ? I 'm not sure . I need help . Thanks !!</content><suggestions>blair/PERSON waldorf/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403492823000">Hi , that dress is gorgeous ! If you want to see if the dress can be made , try this website : www.outerinner.com That is where I got my prom dress , just e-mail them with the attached photo and ask them how much it would cost for them to create something like this . They do an absolutely amazing job , and their dresses are stunning ! If you want to make it yourself , you can get the fabric at stores such as Fabricland/ORGANIZATION or even local fabric stores . Just make sure to take this picture with you when you go shopping so that the sales associate can help you match and measure the amount of cloth and type you need . The gold part is probably lace , but it 's highly unlikely you would find lace as such in fabric stores . Anyways , good luck , I hope you enjoy this experience ! Have fun at prom !</answer><suggestions>fabricland/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403544718000">That 's really pretty , and you should definitly make it . However , there are different options depending on your sewing and dressmaking skills . If you are a good seamstress , and know how to make patterns and so on , go ahead , make the entire dress . I have had good experience here : onlinefabricstore.net Local fabric stores near you might have the lace , otherwise etsy has a very good selection . However , if you are n't great at sewing , it might be easier to get a base dress to put lace on . Good luck !!</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402689585000">Blazer definitely ! With the lacey\/cutout patern on the top half , it would be quite weird for the cardigan to also have a lacey pattern . I think Gold would look good if you have a darker skin tone and you want to stand out . If you want to be on the girlier side then go with Apricot , and white if you want to appear extremely youthful :-RRB- . I have olive skin so I would go for the Apricot if it was a day event , and the Gold if it were more of a night event . I would stay away from Tan and Beige because they can make the skin appear washed out , -LRB- you have to have specific tones for it too look flattering , I do n't know you skin tone so I would n't be able to help you in that department . -RRB-</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

No buttons like a cardigan would have . Have it of flowing material similar to the dress is apricot , gold , white . Which ever suits you and the event best . Have the hem of the shrug belowing and below the bodice . I never shop on line so I do n't know any links .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

You can take paracetamol half hour \/ 40 mins before you do it to ease pain if you are that worried . obviously half hour at least to get the tablet to work . . Make sure you get it done with a needle . Piercing guns are not great because it forces the two bits with the needle against your ear etc. . . Getting it done by a proper needle -LRB- no gun -RRB- is safer and less pain and cleaner finish . . make sure you get solution to clean but dont over clean it . Make sure you use earnings like titanium or proper gold ... fake stuff will just cause infection .
