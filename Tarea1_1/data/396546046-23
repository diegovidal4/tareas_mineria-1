	<title>Get 9 month old to stop nursing ?!?!? Please help ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>My baby has been breastfed for 9 months , no use of the bottle because I am a stay at home mom & never had the need for a bottle . I now regret that decision , as I can not get my baby to stop breastfeeding . She will drink water or juice from a sippy cup , but once there is breastmilk in it she refuses . Dad has tried to with me out of the room only for her to refuse it still and just continue to get more and more upset . She uses nursing as a way to fall asleep also , a habit I desperately want to break . She will not sleep any other way ... wo n't let me rock her , nothing . -LRB- And I would like to add that she is an extremely happy playful baby - until it comes to nursing lol -RRB- . I am trying to wean her ASAP as I have a wedding i am a bridesmaid in in only a month and I ca n't leave her with her dad screaming and crying for hours . : -LRB- I refuse to try the `` Cry it out method '' so please if anyone has advice , I really need to wean my daughter : -LRB- I 'm willing to pump and hAve her take the sippy at this point ... please help . I 'm desperate : -LRB-</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402024280000">When I started the weaning process , I left the house for 2 nights . -LRB- She was almost 2 -RRB- . If she did n't see me , hear me etc , she fell asleep the normal way .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402028636000">Its suggested babies nurse until age two and even beyond if possible , a lot of mothers wean between one and two years though , that being said ... Weaning does n't happen ` asap ' its a process . You say you have a wedding to be at in a month ? Well your baby is n't going to be eating only solid food and getting breast milk from a sippycup . Leaving your breast fed baby for the first time is hard , but you and your husband -LRB- and more importantly your baby -RRB- will be fine . If you do n't have any actual bottles then get her one , start pumping and storing your milk , have your husband try to give her a bottle even though she will fuss and want to nurse from your breast , if she is hungry enough she will take the bottle . It seems mean and impossible but thats how you start , with one bottle feeding . As for the falling asleep nursing habit I think its one we all end up with lol my son does the same thing and has since the day he was born . This will also be a process and not an easy one , but you just do n't give in . Tire her out during the day , and rock her to sleep , put soft music on , dim the lights , walk around . It will take a while for her to get used to it but this is how you sleep train your baby without just leaving them in a crib to cry themselves to sleep .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402060288000">I 'm not clear why being a bridesmaid requires you to wean her early . If she 's very attached and dealing with stranger anxiety , you wo n't cure that by weaning from the breast . -LRB- If anything , if you try to rush the weaning , she 'll be MORE clingy a month from now . -RRB- Most weddings do n't last very long . If she ca n't handle being away from you , then I 'd be working on THAT -- short separations being cared for by daddy where she can learn that mommy will be back soon even though mommy is away now . During the wedding , she can eat solids and drink water from a cup if she 's hungry .</answer><suggestions>daddy/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402122680000">When they say how many weeks you are they normally do n't go by the conception date . They usually add 2 weeks to the date . So , really the day you had sex and conceived would be 2 weeks later around September 13 . So , it 's really unlikely that 's almost a month after you had sex with that other guy .

	<answer epoch="1402324449000">First , not all are . It depends on their parents . But think about this : they are the only children in the family . They do not have any siblings they have to share anything with , including time with their parents . If they need something , it 's not like their parents are busy with anyone else right then , so they get immediate and full attention . Plus , most kids are naturally selfish to begin with . If they do n't have to stop , they wo n't . Sharing is a learned behavior .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402324474000">Because their parent 's all attention and affection on them , and probably their parents tried really hard to have a baby before ...

	<title>Had a dream holding a baby ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I had a dream that I was holding a baby , handed over to me by a male person , the baby is not mine . I am not married have no partner or children . the baby was calm , not crying but looking around perhaps looking for its parent\/s .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403513385000">To see a baby in your dream signifies innocence , warmth and new beginnings . Babies symbolize something in your own inner nature that is pure , vulnerable , helpless and\/or uncorrupted . If you dream that the baby is smiling at you , then it suggests that you are experiencing pure joy . You do not ask for much to make you happy . If you find a baby in your dream , then it suggests that you have acknowledged your hidden potential . If you dream that you forgot you had a baby , then it suggests that you are trying hide your own vulnerabilities ; you do not want to let others know of your weaknesses . Alternatively , forgetting about a baby represents an aspect of yourself that you have abandoned or put aside due to life 's changing circumstances . The dream may serve as a reminder that it is time for you to pick up that old interest , hobby , or project again . If you dream that you are on your way to the hospital to have a baby , then it signifies your issues of dependency and your desires to be completely care for . Perhaps you are trying to get out of some responsibility . If you are pregnant in real life , then a more direct interpretation may simply mean that you are experiencing some anxieties of making it to the hospital when the time comes . To dream of a crying baby symbolizes a part of yourself that is deprived of attention and needs to be nurtured . Alternatively , it represents your unfulfilled goals and a sense of lacking in your life . If you dream that a baby is neglected , then it suggests that you are not paying enough attention to yourself . You are not utilizing your full potential . Alternatively , this dream could represent your fears about your own children and your ability to protect and to provide for them . To see yourself or someone as a baby in your dream refers to your desire to be cared for and nurtured . Alternatively , the dream may mean that you or someone is behaving immaturely . To dream about a starving baby represents your dependence on others . You are experiencing some deficiency in your life that needs immediate attention and gratification . To see a dead baby in your dream symbolizes the ending of something that was once a part of you . To dream of an extremely small baby symbolizes your helplessness and your fears of letting others become aware of your vulnerabilities and incompetence . You may be afraid to ask for help and as a result tend to take matters into your own hands . To dream that you are dipping a baby in and out of water signifies regression . You are regressing to a time where you had no worries and responsibilities . Alternatively , such a scenario is reminisce of when the baby is in the fetus and in its comfort zone . In fact , some expectant mothers even give birth in a pool , because the environment in the water mimics the environment in the uterus . It is less traumatic for the baby as it emerges into the world . So perhaps , the dream represents your search for your own comfort zone . To dream that a baby is walking or dancing refers to the potential and possibilities that life has in stored for you . The future looks bright . The dream may also be a metaphor that you need to take baby steps in your relationship , toward your goal , in a work project or whatever undertaking . If you have a baby in real life , then the dream is a reflection of your hopes for that baby .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

It 's free , completely confidential , and available 24\/7 . Your ex has absolutely no say in who you date , and even if you did have sex with the new guy , it would n't have been any of his business . Just because he waited longer does n't mean he gets special ` dibs ' or anything . If your ex is seriously bothering you , and he wo n't stop harassing you , look into filing a restraining order . Other than that , find someone to talk to about all this . You deserve to have a happy , fulfilled life , and I think talking to a mental health professional about all of this could help you so much .
