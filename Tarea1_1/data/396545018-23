	<answer epoch="1401900847000">. . you can be a athlete , but you 'll never make it up to the best with a lot of overweight . What you have to do is changing your eating habit . Eat more salads and drink more water instead of fast food and sweet drinks like coke or lemonade . With the right exercises and some workout you can loose 2 to 3 pounds a week and the more you loose the more everybody see that you 're more athletic and than you might get a chance that some spotters might see you . .</answer><suggestions>coke/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<content>I never helped by them , but pain drives me to go there . I feel I wasted a lot of time waiting at a & e in the past 12 months .

When my surgery is open I try to get appointment with them . I do n't know what to do as I have had these symptoms nearly a year . I 'm trying to find a new practice but I 'm not at ease with changes . I m almost frightened by the thought of going to the A & e or urgent cares anymore . It mentally agonises me to</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>there are urgent care within the a & e. I contact 111 and it 's them who send me there . I get assesed by a nurse who often send me to the emergency department because of breathing difficulties and rapid heart beat . It 's a waste of time to wait 7hours and not get help .

I 'm sure you would have said the samething to him !</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Finally as I said there 's urgent care within the a & e. That 's why people like me had to wait upto 7hours but emergency cases go through quickly . And that is why they have the triage nurses . Not everyone feels helped by the doctors or feel saved by them . Simply they are professionals who are doing their job . They 're not always the best or get it right . I do n't think I wasted their time</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402036575000">YOU 'VE WASTED SO MUCH TIME IN A&E/ORGANIZATION ?? What you 've done is waste the time of doctors and nurses trained to treat people on the edge of life and those who have had a serious injury -LRB- such as a broken bone -RRB- in the last 48 hours NOT 12 months . You may not be a medic but you know you have a chronic problem that does not need emergency or life saving treatment . If you need medical help out of hours call 111 the THE NHS/ORGANIZATION NON-emergency number . They assess you over the phone and if necessary they can give you an appointment with the out of hours GP service or tell you to go to hospital . Also see if there is a GP drop in center near you . If you need to see your GP the same day you simply phone up the reception and they can get you in to see the doctor . Note this is an emergency service that is not to be used instead of regular appointments . How on earth can you not manage to make a doctor 's appointment ? Everyone else manages . You may have a wait or have to get out of bed early but stop wasting trauma doctors ' time at A&E/ORGANIZATION as someone may be dying while you 're there again ! See your GP , or any GP in the practice , and ask for help . If they ca n't help ask for a referral to a pain management clinic . You do n't feel comfortable enough to change GP surgeries but you 're happy to be told off in A&E/ORGANIZATION ? Get a grip and walk into another surgery with proof of ID -LRB- preferably photographic -RRB- and proof of address -LRB- a utility bill or similar -RRB- and ask to register . You do n't need to tell your previous surgery you 're leaving . This is what you 're allowed to do and this is the right way to get treatment . If you continue to waste resources you may receive a letter warning you to only use A&E/ORGANIZATION for the correct reasons . Autumn EDIT : I expect that comment about your father was aimed at me . You are an evil little thing saying things like that to anyone . I recently nearly died of a heart condition -LSB- in my mid thirties -RSB- so do n't give me that BS . OK - the world should bend backwards for you and I should probably just go off and die as you waste time at A&E with anxiety . Wow bet that 's helped make your pain go away . Talking of shortness of breath and tachycardia -LSB- fast heart rate -RSB- I 've had both for weeks and pass out going to the bathroom , do n't see me in A&E each time .</answer><suggestions>nhs/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

Thanks in advanced</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403228526000">If all you have is dumbells then you can do exercises such as a dumbell press -LRB- flat , decline , and incline -RRB- or dumbell flys . If you do n't have access to a bench you can do them on the floor but it might not be quite as effective but it is much better than nothing . And also , yes pushup can be a great chest exercise if done correctly . Keep good form , which means keep your back straight and go all the way down until your nose touches the ground without resting your body on the ground . Also change it up do tight , normal , and wide grip pushups . If they become quite easy you can add weight if you can keep good form . Good luck .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402246348000">Many women said that their subjective good health habits should not have regular medical appointments . That is the main reason for many people to know they have diabetes too late . Physical examination will often help control and prevent the risk of disease . Here are the tests that you can do to make sure you have a good health . Cholesterol High cholesterol is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the only way to detect it is tested . If your LDL or `` bad '' cholesterol is higher than 130 , you should check annually . If it is lower , you can wait 5 years to check that . Screening for skin cancer U pigmentation and other skin cancers as a threat not only to those who prefer sunning beds . People with white skin have a high risk of skin cancer than darker skinned people . People who have had a sunburn before age 18 and who have loved ones with pigmented tumors are at risk of skin cancer is higher . Please manually check each month to see if there are any distortions mole , enlarged or irregular ridges or discoloration . Tell your doctor if the mole or skin color changes , enlarged or bleeding . Should visit a dermatologist yearly for full body check . Cervical test The test to detect cervical infections and abnormal cells , which can be a sign of cervical cancer . My new guide for women over 30 years old that if test results 3 consecutive years as `` normal '' may prolong the time between tests to 3 years . The HPV test This virus tests for women over 30 to detect sexually transmitted disease that can cause cervical cancer . It is performed on the samples taken for testing cervix . Therefore , when testing for cervical next time , please do always suggest HPV test at the same time . Bone density testing Women are more prone to bone loss , osteoporosis than men , especially after age 30 . Here 's why you should check bone density immediately after the age of 30 . Repeat test 5 year \/ time is required by woman lost 30 % of their bone mass within 5 years from menopause . Underweight women have low bone mass , the more high risk . If your bone density seems low , your doctor will advise you to do more tests to measure the rate of loss of bone mass .

	<content>Okay so in about February I went on a diet and to try and loose some weight . I calculated I would have to eat 1200 calories a day to loose weight . I ate this ammount every day and just before easter I was thrilled to have lost a stone . I then went back to eating just the right ammount to maintain my weight and all was good . Then , over the easter holidays I stupidly ate alot of chocolate and junk food and I managed to pile on quite a few pounds . I was a bit gutted but I knew it was my fault and after the holidays was over I went back on my diet . Soon enough , I saw results again and I was quickly back to my original weight . However , A few weekends ago I had a weekend of terrible eating because I went for a mini weekend break . I ate alot of junk food and cakes and chocolate and unfortunately I managed to stack on about 3 pounds . I thought that if I just went back on a diet I would just loose the weight again but this time it 's not working . I have been eating 1200 calories a day for just over a week and nothing is happening ! I am just maintaining my weight and not loosing any . Normally by a week I would have lost 1-2 pounds but I have lost nothing . Could anyone tell me what I am doing wrong and why it 's not working the same as last time ? I am starting to worry now because its summer and I want to be in good shape . I am not eating unhealthily either , I eat alot of vegetables and foods that are high in fiber and nutrients . can some one explain what is going on ? Thankyou !</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402446460000">People who are following a healthy diet and working out properly are going to lose about 1-2 pounds per week . But that also depends on the type of person you are and what your metabolism is like . What I want to emphasize is that YOU CAN NOT SPOT REDUCE . If your stomach is flabby , there is NO WAY for your to lose only your stomach fat . But what you can do is do cardio . Go outside for a run , go biking , go swimming , or go on youtube/ORGANIZATION and find someone who does `` at-home '' cardio workouts . Cardio can help with reducing fat in your whole body , and eventually you may lose fat in your stomach . I have been told by a lot of fitness professionals that the way to gets abs or a flat stomach is by eating well . `` ABS ARE MADE IN THE KITCHEN '' . Eat healthy : make sure to have mostly protein and veggies , but with some carbs on the side . Stop drinking juice , start drinking more water . A healthy person eats about 2000 calories a day . You can start by eating maybe 1500 calories per day . But honestly , if you are working out hard at home and sweating a lot at least 4-5 times per week AND you are eating healthy , you do n't have to watch your calories so much . Have one cheat meal a week . If you do n't , then your body will crave something and you 'll break . It 's important to give what your body wants sometimes . Lastly , do n't feel pressured to lose weight . You 're only 14 . But I understand if you want to . I do n't want you to develop an eating disorder or become so focused on losing weight or eating less . What I hope is that you will find a healthy eating and an active lifestyle .</answer><suggestions>youtube/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<title>Could this be breast cancer ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I 'm a 17 year old male and last week started feeling pain around my nipple and when I felt it there was a lump there . I have also started having a pain under my arm . I am worrying that it could be breast cancer . I am going to the doctors tomorrow but do you think it could be breast cancer ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402069166000">No . There has never , ever , anywhere in the world been a recorded case of teenage male diagnosed with breast cancer . The youngest man on record was 24 at time of diagnosis , and his case is known all over the world because it was unique . Men do get breast cancer , but fewer than 1 % of those diagnosed with breast cancer are male . Most men diagnosed with it are over 60 . Most breast lumps in men are a condition called gynaecomastia -LRB- US/LOCATION spelling , gynecomastia -RRB- , a button-like growth under the nipple and areola area that can be felt and is sometimes visible to the naked eye ; occasionally it can be quite sore or tender . This increase in the amount of breast tissue is not a tumor and occurs due to changes in hormone balances at times like adolescence . Your doctor will almost certainly reassure you that this is what you have . Even a 17 year old girl would have only a one in 1.3 million chance of breast cancer -LRB- less than 0.0001 % -RRB- , making her almost three times as likely to be struck by lightning -LRB- a one in half a million chance -RRB- . And pain is very rarely a sign of breast cancer ; most people diagnosed with breast cancer have felt no pain at all</answer><suggestions>us/LOCATION gynecomastia/LOCATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402076213000">No . Most people diagnosed do n't have many symptoms , such as pain . You are 17 years old and - guess what - going through puberty . This is common in both men and woman , a little piece of fat that feels tender , firm , and sore that , if you 're a girl , develops into boobs . It 's called a `` breast bud '' or as lo stated , the medical term is gynecomastia .</answer><suggestions>gynecomastia/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<title>What can be wrong ? Too many things at the same time are happening . ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Hello , I 'm 29 , female , no kids , hispanic , and over weight by 40 pounds . About three months ago I had what they called a panick attack which I thought was a heart attack.they checked everything relating to my heart and found nothing wrong . I kept going back to emergency room early April because it kept happening and they all said my heart was fine including my doctor . After careful research I found that I might have GERD and started treating it as Gerd and lord and behold the frequent chest pain went away as we 'll as attacks at night that felt like heart attacks . During this time I developed hip pain on my right side that radiates from my hip all the way to my legs , sometimes it 's really bad . It gets worst with rest or sitting down . Sometimes my leg become numb or starts getting tingly . My right arm also does this . In early April I also got bronchitis out of nowhe but it has gone away since . Today all I have so far experienced is spotting brown blood with clots before and after my period , which has never happened to me , and I have yeast infection which has came back twice in the last two months . I have a dull pain in m hips for 3 months now , my right arm gets numb and stiff when I sleep sometimes . And the worst of all , I found a HUGE HARDENED LUMP under my armpit . And have been experiencing very vivid bizzare clear dreams . m trying to see a doctor today without paying more money to go to emergency room . Please help :-LRB- , I have not had a fever yet but I 'm scared .</content><suggestions>gerd/PERSON gerd/PERSON brown/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402590777000">It is correct to see your own doctor . An ER will get you a shot of something , then send you back to your own doctor . You go to an ER when you are dying . Use urgent care if you need something right away and after the office hours . That is why your GERD was not diagnosed the first time , because you thought something that was n't true . You own Have your GERD completely diagnosed while you 're there . It can be caused by an infection , or it can be other things too . About the newest things , you also see your own doctor . Having brown menses is also normal . Some periods are just like that .</answer><suggestions>gerd/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403022119000">Hey Hi , It looks like you have signs and symptoms of candida yeast infection . I had it for over 15 yrs and it took over my life . Based on my personal experience and 100s of other women that I have talked to and helped here is what I can tell you . 1 . You will experience more itching around private area 2 . You will experience discharge that will make your panties dirty , your discharge could also happen while you are having intercourse . Sort of white cottage cheese . 3 . You may also experience smell down there , at start it 's not that bad but if you leave it untreated then things can get out of control and smell can totally ruin your life . In my case I lost my bf and job it was just too much I couldnt stay still without applying perfume every 10-15 minutes yes it was that bad . 4 . Bloating\/Gas what happens if after a while you dont treat it you may experience some sort of gas\/bloating and it can get really embarrasing . In my case it always came when my bf was just gon na kiss me or when we would get intimate or some other random times of the day while I was doing something . 5 . Painful sex , your sexual life will be severely impact because if you get vaginal yeast infection manifestation of candida then it hurts badly during sex . 3 out of 4 women gets recurring yeast infection and almost 2-3times a year . You can read further about signs and symptoms of candida by sean/PERSON brookwood/PERSON who is a candida expert and well known person who has done a lot of research on topic of candida . In regards with the treatment options -LRB- your immune system is weak so natural remedies might not be enough -RRB- available for you lets look over those , mind you I have spent tens and thousands of dollars and over a decade trying everything so what you will read below is based on my personal experience and after helping 100s of other women suffering from candida 1 . Antibiotics wont really help much . If you keep up with news then CDC recently announced that the age of antibiotics is almost over . They are not great option . Further in case of candida it can help you at start but then candida will come back with furry and it will get harder to treat it . 2 . OTC treatment options , many people on this site and other places or even if you go see a doctor he\/she will recommend you Monistat or Diflucan while these may help cover the symptoms for a while but it wont really treat your candida . It will just go away for a while and come back . Plus its really not a cheap solution and wont do you good in long run . 3 . Home Remedies option - > Not that home remedies dont work the issue is that you will have to eat\/use 20-30 in order to get even a slight benefit for example -- > Garlic - > Can you eat 30 garlic a day ? Unless you live in a cave with no social interaction and nothing I doubt you wan na eat all that garlic . Some people say put it up your vagina , which is so STUPID , it can get stuck I have seen tons of cases where it got stuck and they had to seek help . Its ' stupid dont do it please . Yogurt - > Can you eat 20 boxes of big yogurt ? While it has good bacteria its just not enough plus it doesnt pass the outer later of stomach wall which is full of acids . Here is what I recommend to get relief from yeast infection , or you can say to treat it inside out : 1 . Get on some candida diet , there are tons of them out there I personally recommend Sean/PERSON Brookwood/PERSON 's candida treatment protocol , he has tons of great information about candida . However you can try some other candida diet if you cant follow Sean/PERSON 's protocol . 2 . Make sure your private area is always dry dont leave it wet 3 . Get yourself cotton panties 4 . Make sure you are not taking douches 5 . Get yourself a good candida yeast infection probiotic the one I recommend to all of my friends and other women suffering from candida is probacto probiotics , their probiotic has all the good bacteria strains that can help against candida . I been using them for over a decade now and really no complaints . It also works for all vaginal infections . You may need to take it for at least 3-4 months followed by at least 6 months of multivitamin . 6 . Get a good multivitamin , I recommend Alive Multivitamin it 's great and I take it on daily basis you cant go wrong . 7 . Get these two good potent anti-fungals for your yeast infection . You need to get Cfort10 , take this in the morning and rest of the day I recommend you take CanxidaRemove you can just search for the brand names and you will find out . 8 . Make sure you are drinking 2-3 cups of Nettle Leaf Tea everyday . 9 . Avoid alcohol 10 . Avoid sugar 11 . If its vaginal yeast infection -LRB- which is most of the time for most women anyways -RRB- then avoid having sex with your boyfriend\/husband for a while , as you can pass it along to him . Imagine your embarrassment then when he tells his friends he caught something from you . Penile yeast infection while not that known is still something men suffer from and it can be bothersome for them . And give it at least 2-3 months , once you have recovered make sure you take probiotics at least once a day for a while so that candida does n't come back . I hope it helps , let me know if you have further questions .</answer><suggestions>candida/PERSON candida/LOCATION sean/PERSON brookwood/PERSON candida/LOCATION candida/LOCATION cdc/ORGANIZATION sean/PERSON brookwood/PERSON candida/PERSON sean/PERSON candida/PERSON</suggestions>

	<title>Really weird period , scared ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Please help me , I 'm scared and I have no idea what is causing this . I 've had my period for probably 6 years . I 've been taking birth control for about 6 months and my periods have always been similar to my pre-bc periods only a bit lighter . I do have sex but only like twice a month and my boyfriend has never came in me . I did take two pills four hours late -LRB- two in a row -RRB- & one 14 hours late this month -LRB- very unusual -RRB- , could that have affected it ? Anyways , I got my period -LRB- `` withdrawal bleeding '' -RRB- at the exact day and time it 's been coming for the last few months . It seemed normal , started light red . Later I went to the bathroom and my pad had a bunch of really dark brown , almost black , thick blood on it that smelled really bad . It really freaked me out . But when I wiped after going to the bathroom it was mostly red with a bit of dark brown . The next day I had a little bit of the dark brown but mostly a kind of weird pale red with a medium\/light flow . Today -LRB- third day -RRB- I woke up with a little bit of the dark brown again , and now later some watery red . It 's been pretty light . I have no idea what 's going on , my periods are usually heavier and bright red until the end when they get reddish brown . What could be causing this ? I have been on a bit of a diet for the last month but nothing serious , I still ate an egg in the morning , fruit and some meat for lunch , and a normal dinner , just a lot less snacking & overeating .
