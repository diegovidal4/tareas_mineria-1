	<content>I 'm trying to find the width and I thought it was 3.5 but I got this question wrong on the quiz . What is the real answer and how . Thanks so much !! Question18 For the following data , construct a grouped frequency distribution with 6 classes using the TI-83 \/ 84 .

	<answer epoch="1402934678000">Your maximum value is 26 and your minimum value is 5 . Both values are included , so you ca n't just subtract 26-5 = 21 . You have to subtract and add 1 , so that you will capture both end points : 26 - 5 + 1 = 22 . Now , since all your data points are integers , your class width should also be an integer , therefore 4 . By convention , the lowest class limit is the minimum , so the lowest class boundary would be 5.5 . If you used a class width of 3.5 , your classes , from boundary to boundary , would be as follows : 5.5-9 9-12 .5 12.5-16 16-19 .5 19.5-23 23-26 .5 Do you see the problem ? If your data are all integers , your class boundaries should all be halfway between two integers , because we want the boundary to split the data : We do n't want a dataa point resting on a class boundary . But you have 9 , 16 , and 23 as class boundaries . In your data set you have a 9 . Does it go in the first or second class ? You have a 16 . Does it go in the 3rd or 4th class ? There is no way to tell . Then , what would your midpoints be ? The average of the class boundaries : 7.25 , 10.75 , etc. . What a mess ! But if you use 4 , the class boundaries break very nicely : 5.5 9.5 13.5 17.5 21.5 21.5 27.5 leaving you these class limits and midpoints 6 7.5 9 10 11.5 13 14 15.5 17 18 19.5 21 22 23.5 25 26 27.5 29 The only flaw is that the last class is mostly empty .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>What should my child know to get into a magnet\/charter school ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>In my state , either you go to a public school -LRB- awful in South/LOCATION Louisiana/LOCATION -RRB- or you pay out the wazoo for private schools which provide better educations academically . However , in the last 5-10 years they have rolled out these new charter\/magnet schools that have a higher quality of education and require testing in order to get into the school . The child will have to score within the 85th to 99th percentile in order to be considered . There are other factors such as proximity to the school and a few other factors . However , I am constantly reading to my daughter , but now she is 3 and we will be testing in November\/December of this year for the pre school programs . I want to make sure she can do whatever they ask of her , therefore I am wondering what sort of things to they test on a 4 year old and what else will she need to know in order to get ahead of the very large crowd trying to get into these schools ?</content><suggestions>south/LOCATION louisiana/LOCATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403189904000">The screening they use can vary a great deal . You 'd have to see the website of the school you are interested in to know what they do . Some do a fairly simple screening looking at things like : Enthusiasm Toward Learning `` I look for those qualities that prime children to be successful in school , '' says Kim/PERSON Hughes/PERSON . Does the child approach learning enthusiastically ? Is she eager to explore and discover ? Does she ask questions , take initiative , and persist when tasks are difficult ? Solid Oral-Language Skills Research shows that one of the best predictors of later reading success is a well-developed oral vocabulary in kindergarten . `` PreK kids are learning vocabulary at the rate of five to six words a day , '' says Waite-Stupiansky . `` It 's just amazing how they will retain words if you use them several times in context and conversation . '' The Ability to Listen Children 's literature is a rich resource for expanding language . `` We expect parents to be reading to kids every day , '' says Jayne/PERSON C./PERSON Isaacs/PERSON . `` I can tell which children have been glued to the TV or computer for hours at a time . When we read them a story and ask them to tell us in their own words what they liked or remembered , they 're unable to do so . '' Besides fostering vocabulary and comprehension , reading develops the attention skills necessary in a kindergarten classroom . `` Listening is a key part of school behavior , '' Isaacs/PERSON notes . Students must be able to concentrate on what the teacher is saying , listen carefully for directions , and tune in to the sounds in letters and words . The Desire to Be Independent Encouraging self-help skills is an important step to preparing your child for kindergarten . `` It 's amazing how many kids come to kindergarten not knowing how to hang up a jacket , '' says Argandona/PERSON . It might be quicker for you to do it , but `` independence is critical for helping your child adjust to school , '' he emphasizes . The Ability to Play Well with Others Your child will need your assistance refining essential social skills such as sharing , compromising , turn-taking , and problem-solving . `` Children are naturally egocentric at this age , and we do n't expect them to be able to share everything , '' says Waite-Stupiansky . `` But by the time they reach kindergarten , they should be able to express their feelings in words and begin to understand that two people can use the same thing at the same time . '' Strong Fine-Motor Skills Your child 's hands must be strong enough to master coloring , cutting , pasting , and holding a pencil -- fine-motor tasks that kids use every day in kindergarten . `` By week one , we 're already writing a letter of the alphabet , '' says Argandona/PERSON . `` If kids ca n't hold the pencil correctly , they will fall behind . '' Basic Letter and Number Recognition Kindergarten teachers believe that it is their responsibility to teach kids letter sounds and how to write , but they do hope incoming students can recognize most letters by sight . They also hope children can count to 10 , identify numbers 1 to 5 , and know some shapes and colors . Some may actually administer a test of cognitive abilities . Some just allow entry by lottery and no testing or screening at all . The most important thing may be you and your child 's interest in whatever the theme or focus of the school is -LRB- science , the arts , etc. . -RRB-</answer><suggestions>kim/PERSON hughes/PERSON jayne/PERSON c./PERSON isaacs/PERSON isaacs/PERSON argandona/PERSON argandona/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403044906000">If Spanish is boring then there are two reasons : Either you dislike the subject so much that you choose it to be boring and that will never change until you change your mind set , or your teacher is making it boring which I highly doubt . I have taken Spanish since I was in the 7th grade until 12th year of High School and then a total of 6 more years in College . That makes 12 years of Spanish and I must say that it has never once been boring to me . I have had , for the most part , teachers from one or another region in Spain/LOCATION . This is language that you will need in any work situation you choose as it will be the main language spoken in the US in the near future . I would suggest that you study as much as you possibly can to pass this test and possibly switch to another language if you have to have more language credits .

	<answer epoch="1403056387000">I learned Spanish as a child . -- you know , that `` inferior '' Latin American Spanish ;--RRB- You know our English is considered inferior by some to proper British English . It is n't . It 's just different , as is Australian or Canadian English . I took Spanish in high school for an easy A and to have a background in the grammar and literature I did n't have through my spoken Spanish . I took it through college -LRB- Literature -RRB- for the same reason , but I majored in another area . It 's boring because of the way it 's presented . Conjugate this verb . Have this canned conversation . Some people thrive on that rote because they really have to just memorize , not learn , the language . But it does n't work : sorry , to those who think they have a fine background in it after several years , but nobody becomes bilingual in any language in a classroom . They become bilingual by actually having real , unscripted conversations . And not a crutched one with the local shop keeper . They become bilingual by living where the language is dominant . You understand the nuances of the language when you read literature \* originally \* written in the language . I read `` Love in the Time of Cholera '' and LOVED it -- in Spanish . The English translation is great too , but it is n't Spanish . Your situation now is a perfect example of studying something simply because you have to . Sorry , but the real world does n't care that you do n't enjoy it . I do n't enjoy calculus , but I had to take it for my major . Study up . Conjugate the verbs . Practice those forced conversations . A 65 is a relatively low bar . You can do it .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
