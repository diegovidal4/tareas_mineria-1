	<title>Can I sell my replacement phone ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Recently managed to drop my iPhone 5 in water and ruined it . Went through a 5 day claim process with t-mobile 's insurance and they sent me a brand new iPhone 5c . While it 's great I received a brand new phone , I 'm just not a fan - and although iPhone 5 's can no longer be given as replacements , I 've seen some on ebay or would even pay the difference for an iPhone 5s . My questions are ; \* please excuse my clear and obvious lack of knowledge ! \* if I remove my sim card and restore the phone to factory settings , can I sell the iPhone 5c ? There was a sim card in the new 5c , which I took out and replaced with the sim from my 5 . If sold , do I give the sim card to the buyer or keep it ? For insurance purposes , it would be best to cancel the coverage on iPhone 5c , yes ? -LRB- I 'm assuming it 's a yes , just wanting to make sure -RRB- Do my monthly phone charges stop -LRB- from original iPhone 5 -RRB- if I inform them I 've paid for a new -LRB- well ... new to me -RRB- phone ? If I am able to sell the 5c , do I list it as compatible with T-mobile/ORGANIZATION only ? I 'm sorry if these are obvious answers , I just do n't know how to go about doing this ! And I know I need to talk to T-Mobile/ORGANIZATION , I 'm just a bit tired of going to the store with all the back and forth lately , and work as well eats up my days so thought I 'd try to clear up some questions before I visit . Thank you in advance !</content><suggestions>t-mobile/ORGANIZATION t-mobile/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402988516000">Yes you can sell it . You take your sim out and use it on whatever next phone you will have . You list it as T-mobile/ORGANIZATION only , and the person that will buy it will put their own sim in it to use it . If it is a replacement phone , you should n't be charged anything on your bill . But if you have n't canceled your service then you will still be charged monthly . Your sim card is basically your service card and as long as it 's working you keep paying for it . If you lose yours you will have to cancel it right away so somebody else does n't use your minutes\/service .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Is it important to play the first Elder Scrolls Games to play the most recent ones ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I want to buy the most recent Elder Scrolls : Skyrim , but I have n't played the others , so I was wondering how important they were , or how hard it would be to play the last . Is there a game number where its good enough to start so you get good graphics and gameplay , but can still understand whats going on ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402109160000">I never played any Elder Scrolls game before playing Skyrim , and I 've had no problem understanding the game or getting through it -LRB- three times -RRB- . The events in TESV : Skyrim take place a few centuries after the events in Oblivion/LOCATION and Morrowind/LOCATION , and in a different location -LRB- Oblivion/LOCATION takes place in Cyrodiil/LOCATION , home of the Imperials , and Morrowind takes place in Morrowind , home of the Dunmer , while Skyrim takes place in Skyrim -RRB- . There are some connections and references , and even a few characters who reappear in some form or another from the previous games , but only in a minor way . From what I 've read , each game was designed by Bethesda/PERSON to be a stand-alone experience that could be played without necessarily playing the others .</answer><suggestions>cyrodiil/LOCATION morrowind/PERSON bethesda/LOCATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402111360000">Each Elder Scrolls game is a stand-alone game which can be played without any prior knowledge of previous games . Each game -LRB- except for Arena -RRB- is set in a different region of Tamriel and in a different time . There is non-essential lore which ties all the games together however . And there are some recurring characters -LRB- for example M'aiq the Liar appears in Oblivion/LOCATION and also Skyrim -RRB- , but they do n't affect the gameplay . It is n't important at all to know about previous games to play Skyrim . As far as graphics are concerned , naturally the best is Skyrim . Oblivion/LOCATION has decent graphics also . Morrowind 's graphics are dated , but the game is still very playable . For Arena and Daggerfall , you will need a DOS emulator to even play the games since they wo n't run under any version of Windows . Their graphics are VERY old .</answer><suggestions>morrowind/PERSON daggerfall/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402164887000">No . The Elder Scrolls Online is a spin-off and is n't related to Skyrim . It was actually released after Skyrim so Skyrim technically comes first .</answer><suggestions>skyrim/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402176007000">You can `` build your own '' Cyberpower gaming PC by selecting components , believe it or not , on the Walmart/ORGANIZATION website . They start at $ 445 . Check out http:\/\/www.walmart.com\/ip\/CYBERPOWERPC-Build-Your-Own-Gaming-Desktop-Bundle-Select-Case-Processor-Memory-Hard-Drive-and-more\/21621640 .</answer><suggestions>walmart/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402177777000">Here is an Intel/ORGANIZATION based as $ 710 for the basic system without a cpu cooler upgrade , or keyboard or mouse or headphones\/headset\/speakers . Sale prices do change frequently http:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/p\/2vkdrH Here I swapped out the cpu and motherboard from Intel/ORGANIZATION i5 to a lower gaming performance AMD/ORGANIZATION FX-6350 . It also reduces the ethernet and audio performance of the motherboard . http:\/\/pcpartpicker.com\/p\/v8w6qs That is $ 651 The lower end CPU may bottleneck a few games cut from ultra to high settings . -LSB- add : The motherboard used for this AMD/ORGANIZATION build is SLI compatible to NVidia/ORGANIZATION graphics cards and that improves AMD/ORGANIZATION crossfire performance by 10 % . In a second GPU add , this motherboard does better than the one for the Intel build in graphics performance , but in audio , the Intel/ORGANIZATION using very good Realtek ALC1150 audio as better than the ALC892 of the AMD/ORGANIZATION build . Killer E2200 gaming ethernet of the Intel/ORGANIZATION MSI/ORGANIZATION MB is better than the standard gigabit ethernet of the AMD/ORGANIZATION . -RSB- The performance of the part list shown for either is a little better than a PS4 . It is a few percent lower than these fps : http:\/\/www.anandtech.com\/bench\/product\/1043 Probably about 40fps ultra 1080p BF4 for the Intel/ORGANIZATION based system . As you can see , meets the recommended for BF4 : http:\/\/www.game-debate.com\/games\/index.php?g_id=3060&game=Battlefield+4&p_make=Intel&p_deriv=Core+i5-4590+3.3GHz&gc_make=ATI&gc_deriv=Radeon+R9+270&ram=8&checkSubmit=#systemRequirements FX-6350 performance is game by game dependent to ones that use the 6-cores fully . Crysis-3 and BF-4 should do OK . A few others may need settings adjustment in the game below ultra to bring up the FPS . It is still a very good CPU . I do not build PCs . but have many years in Component Engineering experience in the pc industry and know parts and performance and compatibility and show gaming performance . Actual building is shown on youtube/ORGANIZATION . Carey/PERSON Holzman/PERSON is very good : http:\/\/www.youtube.com\/playlist?list=UUmWNCO9wSjzOz1UV8jCvIHA PCPARTPICKER is a good shopping and compatibility site . You can change parts on the list and save your list or just share the permalink like I did . I chose a low cost wide computer case USB 3.0 that has two fans and looks nice . The power supply is good and adequate . http:\/\/www.realhardtechx.com\/index_archivos\/Page447.htm http:\/\/www.realhardtechx.com\/index_archivos\/Page362.htm</answer><suggestions>intel/ORGANIZATION intel/ORGANIZATION nvidia/ORGANIZATION intel/ORGANIZATION intel/ORGANIZATION intel/ORGANIZATION msi/ORGANIZATION intel/ORGANIZATION youtube/ORGANIZATION carey/PERSON holzman/PERSON</suggestions>
