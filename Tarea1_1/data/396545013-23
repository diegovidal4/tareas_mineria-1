	<content>I have a credit card I recently got from a bank and I been purchasing stuff all month and paying it the next day or two even tho it gave me about a month to pay it . So yesterday I bought 160 dollars worth of stuff and I checked my online banking and I saw there was a closing date on the 24 which is Tuesday .

Anything will help .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403466595000">This is not bad . Your statement has a closing day each month , at which point you will be billed for the items you have charged . You do not owe anything until this statement closing date . It 's good to pay off your credit card , but doing so after every purchase is a little excessive . You generally have 20 to 30 days from the statement closing date to make a payment before you are charged interest . Check the terms of your credit card . If you do not make a payment on the balance due on your statement , you will be charged interest and penalties . If you only pay the minimum due , you will be charged interest . If you pay off your balance in full every month , you wo n't own any extra fees or interest .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<content>I have been with the landscaping company for 2 years , and have been a crew leader for the last year . My boss has always pushed his employees to perform at max capacity , and has never observed our federally mandated breaks , but at least he was a nice guy to begin with . For the last 9 months or so , he has had an explosive temper , and been verbally abusive to all his employees . He cusses at us , calls names , etc. . I 've always gone above and beyond my job duties ; coming in when I 'm sick or injured because I know he has no one to cover for me , visiting job sites after hours to fix anything the client was unhappy with , or to pick up company property that was left behind . I 've worked myself into the ground for this man , and spent the last almost year hating my job , but on my last day off , my boss called me and told me I had an hour to report to a lab to submit a urine test . I complied , and gave a clean drug test , and my boss contacted me the next morning to say he had hired a new crew leader to run my crew ?! None of my co workers were told to go drug test . Basically , I feel like my hostile boss has been looking for a reason to fire , demote , or degrade me now for months , and since he finally found a replacement for me , he was hoping I 'd give a dirty test so he 'd have `` cause '' to fire me and not give me unemployment .

Then , Ask them nicely to look at the stats of your home and then compare to the other homes in the neighborhood and then tell them exactl how much you think the tax estimate should be .

	<title>eBay/ORGANIZATION dispute ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So , recently I purchased a Japanese brand name dress on eBay/ORGANIZATION . The seller lived close to me and I wanted this dress for a really long time . She marked it as new without tags with a sale price of $ 85 -LRB- this brands dresses are usually around $ 95 -RRB- , however , I did the auction and won it for $ 55 + $ 5 shipping . I opened a dispute stating : `` I just received this dress . While I did notice the large grease-like stain on the back of the inner dress , I did n't check the rest and left a positive review . With better lighting , I found several splotchy orange stains inside of the dress as well as the outer parts . In addition , you can clearly see that the grease-like stain is several shades darker than the white inner dress i.e. dirt . Not only that but two buttons are missing from the front ! I 'm just really upset that this was described as brand new , because it most certainly is not . '' She replied with `` I 'm so sorry , I should have checked . I trusted the person , but from the next time , I will make sure everything is correct . '' So , i 'm assuming she was selling for a friend ? I want to ask for a partial refund but I 'm not sure if she 'd oblige . I want to keep the dress but that 's all she wrote . I do n't know if asking for a partial refund is reasonable , I think so , because I was lied to . What do you think ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>

I want challenges and meet them head on . I love difficulty because it bring us the adrenalin rush every now and then . I do not like a company paying me doing nothing . I want to contribute and be part of the company and reach that ladder of success with sheer blood and guts . Some people love jobs that are so easy and stress free . And get paid doing nothing . I am a different guy . In the corporate insurance field I get to know a lot of people that I can personally emulate or take as an inspiration how they become who they are now . Success did n't come from easy job and stress free environment , I believe great people did n't became great for nothing .
