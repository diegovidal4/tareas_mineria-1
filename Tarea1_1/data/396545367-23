	<answer epoch="1403534361000">I agree with the other poster that you should drink about 2 liters daily . This is equivalent to four 16.9 oz water bottles . If you are drinking 15 per day , you need to see your doctor to have further testing done . Increased thirst like that is a sign of diabetes . That is not meant to scare you , but to make you aware .
