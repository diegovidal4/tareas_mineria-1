	<title>Mini baby spider infestation on window , help ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So the weather has gotten really warm recently , so I decided to open my window fully for about an hour . Anyway when I came back all these tiny red things were on the window , I asked my dad what they were and he said they were baby spiders . He said I should leave the window open and they 'll all go away eventually , but I did n't want to wait so I hit them all with a cloth and then vacuumed them up . The following day I only opened the window a tiny bit and an hour later they came back with the same amount of them as yesterday with two slightly bigger brown ones , anyway I 'm going away for a week tomorrow so is there something I should use to get them away for good or will they leave naturally , please help ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403105836000">That is probably Clover mites . They are small , reddish mites , about the size of the head of a pin and usually moving around very quickly . Clover mites are slightly larger than the red spider mite and can be easily seen with the unaided eye . Problems with them usually occur in Fall & the Spring . When the mites are crushed , they leave rusty or blood-red spots . You can place sticky traps on windowsills or other places where you found them .

	<answer epoch="1403106358000">You really do n't need to do anything about these , they are totally harmless , and more likely red spider mites . they are pest in plants , but if you have other real spiders about , they will eat the mites .

	<answer epoch="1401661063000">You can go to IKEA/ORGANIZATION - I got nice curtains there for about 25 dollars a window . But , even cooler : I like to do a ` shabby-chic ' bohemian look . What I do is hammer two nails above the corners of the window . Then I tie a cord between the two nails . I pick out a piece of very pretty fabric - IKEA/ORGANIZATION , Michael/ORGANIZATION 's , Hancock/ORGANIZATION 's , Tuesday/ORGANIZATION Morning/ORGANIZATION - and then cut and trim it to fit the window . If you are a good sewer , you can sew a small loop near one end so you can slide it over the cord and open or close it at will . If you 're not a good sewer , you can use clothes pins . The key is picking out a good fabric . I 've seen people cut out strips of colors and create a rainbow curtain .

The door I have now is larger than most doors because my Bedroom is a garage conversion , so a really big Renaissance door should look nice . How can I do this ? http:\/\/www.bing.com\/images\/search?q=medival+door&qs=n&form=QBIR&pq=medival+door&sc=0-0&sp=-1&sk=#view=detail&id=2C5A03CA1518004BF71FCAFFF996E1597E321D60&selectedIndex=0 \* They just do not make doors like they used to , if you buy a door from home depot , you will get a door that is hollow and flimsy . \* Any tips greatly appreciated . I will probably have to hand cut everything unless I borrow a friends tool -LRB- or if Lowes will cut it -RRB- . Thank you</content><suggestions>lowes/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402464179000">1 . you can get solid core doors , you just have to specify what you want ... or order one . Buy the door you need ... do n't bother with plywood ... it would be nearly impossible to get it square\/plumb ... so it fits in the doorway . 2 . Every door in those pictures has wrought iron fixtures . You 'll need a black smith that specializes in that stuff ... or look for barn door hardware in black . 3 . The decorative studs can be found at Upholstery stores . I found something similar at conchos.com -LRB- look at the overstock sales -RRB-</answer><suggestions>black/PERSON smith/PERSON</suggestions>

	<title>Will sharpie marker get messed up in the wash on ultra cotton shirts ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Me and my friends bought shirts and drew our names and stuff on it just a few hours ago . But I need it to shrink because it is WAY TOO BIG . Is it okay to wash it or will the ink bleed all over the shirt</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402364728000">Washing wo n't shrink the shirts ... not even using hot water . Machine drying wo n't shrink them , either . You 'll need to alter the shirts to shrink them . -LRB- See picture below -RRB- . If you do n't know how to sew , many dry cleaners alter clothing . This woman washed her 100 % cotton shirts in hot water and dried them in the dryer 3 times and the shirts did not shrink : http:\/\/answers.yahoo.com\/question\/index;_ylt=Akrw0YaMpYt8SFtqZAjZErMz53NG;_ylv=3?qid=20110316185532AAzyZrD As for the Sharpie , any washing could potentionally fade the marker . Hot water will fade it the most . Hand washing using cool water and Woolite will fade it the least . Machine drying will also fade it . Hanging to air dry will not cause fading .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402378640000">You 're not going to shrink it a significant amount by washing and drying it , no matter how hot and how many times you do it . That 's just how it works . While you 'll shrink it a tiny bit -LRB- enough that if the shirt just fit it would be a little tight afterward -RRB- , you ca n't buy a shirt that 's way too big and shrink it down to the size you think it should be . As for the Sharpie , it will fade with washing , but you can set the ink by ironing it and then washing it in cold water with vinegar .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402873092000">You do n't build a fire , you make a fire .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402873329000">You need something to act as a firestarter so that the twigs will catch . If you do n't have any lighter fluid , try shredding some paper into thin strips . Use your lighter to light a few of the strips as if you were lighting a candle , then light the rest of the paper . Depending on how windy it is , you may need to set up a windbreak so the fire has a chance to catch and grow . If you are using a grill , try using the lid to block the wind . If you 're using a pit , things like coolers with the lid propped open work well .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

Use cotton balls or wad of dryer lint slathered in petroleum jelly . You can stuff a number of these cotton wads into a small container for a quick , easily portable , water-resistant fire starting kit . In the grill bottom , crumble loosely some newspaper , place one or two of the petroleum jelly coated cotton balls , fluffed up a bit , lay the twigs across this base , and then add the charcoal pieces in a low pyramid or cone shape . Light the newspaper all around the edge , watching to see the treated cotton wads also catch , and put on the grill cover . Wait until the charcoal has burned to gray , then place the metal cooking grill over the burning charcoal heat and add the food .

	<content>They are harassing me . Besides feces in my fountain ; my hedge in the front between our property but a foot & 1\/2 inside my property line has had 2 of the plants die and my hedge has been fine for 30 years . When I trimmed the hedge I found a sizeable piece of infected bark from an oak tree up under it . They moved in 6 yrs ago and keep asking when I am going to cut down my Redwood tree in my back yard . It does not grow onto their property ; I trim it yearly . They have let their Mulberry Tree grow into my from yard and its over my roof and rubbing on my new roof when the wind blows . It has two big roots that have grown into my yard creating like a sink hole in between the 2 roots . They cut their Mulberry on one side of their tree next to their hous the other side they have let grown . They have told me that they do not like it when I trim my hedge that is in the front yard -LRB- I trim it twice a year -RRB- and the hedge was planted so it would be 1 & 1\/2 feet on my property ... so I could comfortably trim it . I have lived here 35 years they moved in 6 years ago and asked me to cut down my liquid Amber and I did because they told me that they were sure the limbs were going to break off . I do not like problems . I am not a fighter . I hate this I have always had nice neighbors .
