	<answer epoch="1403482796000">In my experience this wo n't work . Generally it plugs up the radiator as much as anything .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403484886000">There are better products out there for less money . Go to Autozone and buy K&W nano seal . It 's about $ 35 -LRB- half the price of Blue Devil -RRB- Even under the best circumstances these sealers only work 50 % of the time . So if you 're gon na try , do n't overpay .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403485055000">Somewhere around $ 30 , but `` Fence '' is right - it is no cure-all and can make things worse . It may not be any of my business but are you sure you have a bad head gasket , and is it just slowly consuming coolant ? Blue Devil wo n't work on really bad head gaskets and it is only a temporary measure to squeeze a few more months out of a dying engine .

	<answer epoch="1402922904000">if you feel grinding right before belt broke id be inspecting the drive belt and pullys , like the belt tensioner pully . idler pully ... suspect one to be locked up \/ out of place , power steering cant go out unless the pump stopped turning which is operated by the belt ... if the drive belt broke off im sure the car would shut off like that cause alternator isnt turning ethier and then battery dies , altho it should of ran on battery power till the battery died but you don ; t truly no when the belt broke also ... the drive belt turns with the engine the same as the timing belt does . . if the timing belt breaks it may back fire from timing be thrown off but basicly it would die instantly and the engine would crank\/turn over extremely fast when you try to start the engine back up ... you will notice a difference . the water pump should also be with the timing belt -LRB- usualy -RRB- basicly im trying to tell you i think your issue is the drive belt . . it runs the power steering and alternator and the a\/c all that good stuff ... i think the belt broke . probably grinding from getting caught on things after it broke . . or if a faulty part caused it to break . . basicly just start inspecting things ... pop the hood and start looking at the pulleys and the broken belt . . make sure everything turns freely ...</answer><suggestions>ethier/PERSON</suggestions>

	<content>This happens here and there , until lately it has happened almost all the time .

	<title>Car air conditioner wo n't take refrigerant ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So the other day , I thought I 'd recharge my A\/C since it seemed like it could be a little chillier . I 've done it before and had a bottle that I \* thought \* had some more stuff in it . The problem is , I 'm a dope , and apparantly I did more harm than good . So I turned on the A\/C , plugged in the gauge , saw that it was a little low , and pulled the trigger . Shook it a bit as I tried to empty the can , checked the gauge , and it looked like it did n't increase the PSI at all . I also noticed that in my twisting and shaking , the part of the can that was discharging seemed to be leaking , because it slightly untwisted itself . Fast forward -- I get on the road later , turn on the A\/C , and it wo n't engage . Just keept clicking on for a half second and then turning right back off , cycling every 2-3 seconds or so . I googled/ORGANIZATION it and found that it was likely that the system was low on refrigerant , figuring I probably let the refrigerant out somehow and so it was cycling on and off not having the pressure it needs to engage . I got a new can and tried to recharge the system , but it did n't seem like the A\/C would accept the refrigerant . I 'm guessing it was probably because the compressor would n't engage . What 's my solution ? Do I jumper the compressor to force it to engage , and then recharge ? Will I hurt the compressor doing that if it 's only for a minute or so while I 'm recharging the A\/C ?

	<answer epoch="1403483921000">As for the chances of getting a job , it depends on the country you live in , the state of the national economy and the health of the aviation industry in that country . Newly trained , inexperienced pilots have the hardest time finding a job pretty much everywhere , but in some countries the prospects are far worse than in others . Since there are dozens of different flying occupations , including airlines , salaries are all over the place . In the USA/LOCATION , they can range from under $ 20k per year to over $ 200k . New-hires earn the least and 30-year veterans earn the most . it is difficult to give you an average figure because of the wide disparity between types of flying jobs and seniority , but the U.S./ORGANIZATION Bureau/ORGANIZATION of/ORGANIZATION Labor/ORGANIZATION Statistics/ORGANIZATION gives $ 68,000 as the median salary for airline pilots , meaning that half earn less and half earn more .

	<content>Im 19 right now , I got my license at 18 on my third try . I have to drive to school almost every day so I get that its a ` necessary evil ' and whatnot but just the thought of getting into my car makes me feel like throwing up ! and to be honest once I actually get into my car and start driving I do n't feel crazy bad anymore , but I still really hate driving . I have n't been in any major accidents so I do n't know why I feel like this about driving . My back ends up hurting when I drive , although thats probably because Im so stiff haha , and I am a little paranoid that something might happen , but I do n't feel like thats a good enough reason to feel this badly .

Sometimes just thinking that I 'm going to have to drive for the rest of my life makes me want to break down and cry , though it does make me feel better that Im not the only one that feels this way . Does anyone have any advice for how they get through this ? Or at least some ideas to help hype me up about driving ?

When I opened the hood , I saw one plug that had all of these different colored wires showing , and at the end , it 's plug in part was gray and thick . I saw it just dangling right behind the engine and I do not know where it belongs . The battery works fine , and powers everything in the car , including the lights .

	<title>Car sputters to life then runs fine ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I have an 2002 Ford/ORGANIZATION Focus and for the past couple of months I have been having an issue with starting my car up . About a week ago my car died on me completely and would not start so I figured that the problem was my starter because of the weak start I 've been experiencing for months and the fact that my lights and everything were still on . I managed to get it towed to a mechanic thinking that it was the starter just to find out that the starter was fine and that the car went back to running perfect after a full charge , apparently the battery was almost completely dead . I went to autozone to get the battery checked out and figured out that everything was okay with that . I got the alternator changed and figured out everything was fine with that also . I unhooked my sound system from the battery and am still having problems . At this point I have no idea what it is because I 've had problems with this in the past and resolved it with a new alternator . At that point in time all the fuses were checked too and found out that nothin out of that was draining it .

	<answer epoch="1402527960000">If its driveable , take it to Autozone/ORGANIZATION and get them to scan the computer for diagnostic trouble codes.You can have codes stored even if the check engine light is n't on.If codes are present , this will either tell you exactly what 's wrong and causing the problem or it will give you a good place to start trouble shooting.If the battery , alternater , starter , and fuses are all ok double check every cable\/wire attached to the battery , starter , alternater , and engine\/body\/frame grounds.Make sure they 're tight and corrosion free.The grounds on a computer controlled car are very critical to proper function because computer circuits and sensors work on very small voltages -LRB- 5volt reference signal -RRB- There are a few sensors that cause hesitation -LRB- TPS , MAF -RRB- The maf can be cleaned withs electrical contact cleaner.Sensors that cause hard\/no start -LRB- MAP , Crank , Cam -RRB- Check the vacuum hose to map sensor for leaks and deterioration.The ignition module is another likely culprit.Autozone can test this module if you bring it .</answer><suggestions>autozone/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402536001000"># 1 batteries need to be test for amps , alot of high school student work at parts houses and dont know this , you can have 12 volts and no amps , amps start the car volts run everything else , thats what the cca is on your battery , # 2 if a battery is ran dead it is very rare it will ever take a full charge and hold it , usually it will say full then it will blead off , it all depends on how many times its been ran dead and the age of the battery , and brand , # 3 was the alt tested multiple times , they will test good then right after on the next test they will test bad , it all depends on the RPMs the tester is running at , alts should be around 14 volts constant , a bad alt will sometimes test 14 at 2000 rpm but only 8 at 1200 , thats why you do multiple test , also heat , dirt , grease \/ oil will mess with the test so make sure you clean the alt as best you can before the test , # 4 if your car has a dead battery after driving , you most likely have a bad battery , it was running on the alt and that will burn it up if it goes to long , if the car dies and wont restart you probly have a bad alt , easy test wait till its dark and start the car , turn on you head lights high beams , now start turning things on like the heater fan to high if your lights go dim you got watch your volt guage it should drop just a little then almost immediately pick up to 12 to 14 volts , if it doesnt rev engine and see if the lights get brite then dim when you let off , thats usually a bad alt ,</answer><suggestions>cca/ORGANIZATION brite/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1401895854000">the best thing you could do for a cheap sports car is to get something used . sports cars often lose a lot of their value rather quickly . if you can only really afford something entry level when buying new , buying used opens up a world of possibilities . Personally I would go with an E46 BMW M3 . you can find them for around $ 15,000 and they are loaded with features that similarly priced new cars do n't have yet . they are great sports cars with ample performance . they have rear seats and luxury interiors . if this is too old of a car then I 'd suggest a Hyundai/ORGANIZATION Genesis Coupe . a used 2.0 T can be found for around $ 13,000 . the great thing about the genesis coupe -LRB- especially the 2.0 T -RRB- is just how easy it is to mod it . there are factory made suspension and exhaust mods should you want to retain a warranty . if you do n't you can still very easily install aftermaket mods . lowering springs , coilover dampers and anti roll bars will give you a level of agility rivalling that of a scion FR-S . -LRB- if you want to retain some comfort but make it a bit more agile on turning just an anti roll bar will help a lot as bump performance remains the same while rolling is resisted -RRB- enginewise an older genesis coupe will put out 210 hp which is n't anything too impressive but with a couple easy to install mods you can get an extra 50 hp in a matter of hours . an intake , ECU and exhaust change can increase power and at the same time improve fuel efficiency a bit . if you decide to improve other parts like the fuel and cooling systems you can gain around 100 hp fairly easily -LRB- not as easily as the bolt on intake , ECU and exhaust -RRB- this will put it up on competitive levels as the american pony car trio -LRB- mustang , camaro , challenger -RRB- with the benefit of a much sportier suspension and much lower weight . if you get a newer model that 210 hp turns into 274 hp . -LRB- there was an engine update for model years 2013 and up -RRB- . in this case those easy engine mods put you on competitive levels with an Nissan/ORGANIZATION 370z with the benefit that you still retain the rear seats . btw I am 6 feet tall and weight over 200 pounds -LRB- i 'm a big guy -RRB- and I found the rear seats of the genesis to be the most comfortable of the mustang camaro challenger and FR-S . I also personally like the looks of the genesis best but that 's just my own opinion . i found the mustang and challenger to be too old school and the camaro has horrible visibility . the FR-S looks great but those rear seats are useless for me since the drivers seat touches the rear seat when I 'm in it . if you want more idea just send me a message through yahoo/ORGANIZATION answers and I 'll be glad to help .

	<answer epoch="1402930440000">When you check the pressure the following day , is it holding the charge ? That is not clear from what you wrote . If it will take a charge then it is loosing R134A plain and simple . You just have n't found the leak . Have you checked the Schrader filler valve to see if it leaks ? Could also be seals at or around the compressor , could be where the evaporator lines go into the condensor . Could be a pinhole leak in a line .

Also have you felt the line from the compressor to the evaporator to see if it is in fact cold but perhaps a diverter door is n't opening under your dash ?

	<answer epoch="1402930806000">I 'm assuming that re-charging the system gets the system cooling again and after a day or two it stops cooling and a re-charge gets it cooling again . This is a hefty leak . Try using your blacklight at dusk or dawn , maybe even in the dark . It 's surprising how much a well lit area `` bleaches '' out the reflective effect of the dye . Keep a strong flashlight handy to aim at any dye stains that you see , because you can see the dye in the black-lit area but it 's too dark to see the parts with your eyes in the dark .
