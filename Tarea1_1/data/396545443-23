	<answer epoch="1403389521000">Long hair has nothing to do with hairballs , no more than with cat allergies -LRB- which are more about saliva and skin oils -RRB- . I have a DSH -LRB- Domestic Short Hair -RRB- cat , a true tuxedo and she has a very dense shiny coat and sheds like crazy . I have to stay on top of that issue with daily brushing , only once a day as to not irritate her skin , using the right brush , like a gentle one with protective tips , and the right method to use it . You should also use a lint brush ... I need about half a dozen sheets a day right now -LRB- using the giant one -RRB- . I ca n't believe how much hair I get that does not end up in her stomach . http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Hartz-Slicker-Brush-for-Cats\/dp\/B000VQ9NG0\/ref=sr_1_20?s=pet-supplies&ie=UTF8&qid=1403076289&sr=1-20&keywords=cat+brush http:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Evercare-Giant-Roller-Refill-Sheets\/dp\/B0029X48AO\/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&qid=1403097507&sr=8-3&keywords=evercare+giant+pet+lint+roller Then you get the Hairball Formula Diet -LRB- like from Purina One -RRB- and some paw gel from your vet . You should use the paw gel once a week in the winter , twice a week for cat shedding a lot , every day in the spring\/summer when they shed a lot . Bald spots are a health concern and you should get your cat to your vet for assessment about skin issues . Excessive licking could be due to itching from parasites ... Even if you do preventive monthly treatment for parasites like fleas , heartworms , ear mites , hookworms , roundworms , your cat could still get a tapeworm .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402554605000">Your kitten is a normal healthy kitten . Kittens have lots of energy at this age . Getting him a playmate will help . Try to get a kitten similar in age to the one you already have . After the two get used to each other , they will play together . In playing together , they also will learn how to inhibit biting and scratching and save their rough play for each other instead of biting humans . When your kitten bites you too hard , hiss and spit air at him , then ignore him for awhile . This is how a cat disciplines another cat for getting too rough . The sex of the second kitten does n't matter as long as you have both kittens spayed\/neutered .</answer><suggestions>hiss/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402560685000">I completely agree with the previous comment . If you get another kitten now , there is a much larger chance of them both getting along and teaching each other how to appropriately play -LRB- ie not with fingers or feet -RRB- . But for the future , when playing with these types of cats , only use toys that dangle on a stick or are completely hands free , to save you pain , and them confusion , later down the road : -RRB-</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

To be a well socialized cat she needs to meet people and interact with them . Cats like to climb so have taller items she can get up . She probably is box trained ? The ferals that came my way pretty much figured it out because I was clueless .

	<title>What skin condition could my dog have ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Around the start of spring , my dog 's nipples became swollen and he got a few spots he was biting . At the time I did n't think much of it and just treated the spots , bathed him , and made sure he had frontline even though I have never seen fleas . The swollen nipples i believe are from him scratching at his chest ... He got several more spots which I then started treating with Benadene Hot Spot Formula and I gave him a couple benadryl a day for allergies . At that point I was thinking it was allergy related due to the time of year , but he 's never had this happen before . I 've done that for a couple weeks and while some spots healed , new ones formed and he is loosing patches of hair where he is biting . I stopped giving him the allergy meds to see if his scratching would get worse , but it seems fairly consistent either way . I 've given him flea baths about once a week , plus i clean his fur and paws when he comes in from outside . I also have a hydrocortisone spray with aloe that I use often . This has gone on now for a couple months and it 's not severe , but it is consistent . The spots he gets are red and sometimes black or swollen , which is partially due to his biting , but I 'm not sure why areas would turn black . I was concerned it might be mange , but from what i read , mange is extreme and contagious to humans . Plus I read that if he has mange then there 's a 95 % chance it will be around his ears , but it 's not at all ... his spots are more on the hind end and stomach\/chest</content><suggestions>mange/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402679959000">Please read the link below for other possible causes but I would like to address mange here as I can see that there are many misconceptions about this condition . As you may already know and for the benefit of those who read this post and are not familiar with this problem , mange is a skin condition caused by tiny mites that you ca n't see with the naked eye . There are three types of mites that attack dogs most often : demodectic -LRB- not contagious and may itch or not -RRB- , sarcoptic -LRB- very contagious and extremely itchy -RRB- and cheyletiella -LRB- contagious and mildly itchy -RRB- . The typical symptoms as the mange condition progresses include hair loss and scaly or crusty skin . If the condition causes itchiness , scratching opens the door to secondary skin infections -LRB- bacterial or fungal -RRB- that may cause an unpleasant odor . Unfortunately -LRB- except in the case of demodectic mange on puppies with immature immune systems -RRB- , mange does not go away on its own and the lesions continue to spread so it should be treated as soon as possible . The most common type of mange today is demodectic mange -LRB- not contagious type -RRB- which is triggered by a weak or compromised immune system due mainly to factors such as immaturity -LRB- as in the case of puppies -RRB- , improper nutrition -LRB- commercial food being the main culprit -RRB- , stress and advanced age . Vets can do a deep skin scraping and check the sample under a microscope to detect the presence and type of mite . However , everyone should be aware that there are some very serious problems caused by the use of the most common prescribed treatments and there are safe and affordable alternative treatments to cure any type . Regardless of the type of mange , in order to cure it you need to treat with a medication that kills the mites . The mange medications most often prescribed by vets contain pesticides and other toxic chemicals that are detrimental to your dog 's health with resulting health issues that you will have to face sooner or later . These medications include Ivermectin -LRB- also known as Ivomec -RRB- and Amitraz -LRB- also known as Mitaban -RRB- . See the links that follow for toxicology information . It is always advisable to check the veterinary drug database for the side effects of any medication prescribed by your vet http:\/\/www.drugs.com\/vet\/ Thankfully , there are a number of effective alternative treatments out there that are safe and natural at a reasonable cost that will kill the mites . You can easily do some research in the Internet to find out about these and compare your options . I prefer the ` spray type ' because it is inexpensive , very effective , convenient to use -LRB- no mixing and no mess -RRB- , and it is natural and harmless to pets and humans . Hope this helps .

	<answer epoch="1403229296000">Do n't , making a mesh lid will not increase oxygen , get an air pump with an air stone -LRB- bubbler -RRB- which puts the oxygen into the water and surface movement increases oxygen too which air stones do good luck , also if you do n't already , get live plant 's , and I 'm not sure your maintenance schedule but a 15-20 % water change every week -LRB- unless you already do more then that in which case keep up the good work -RRB- will help keep water quality at a good level</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403229595000">do not make up answers that are wrong for problems that can not occur . A mesh top is unacceptable as a top for a fish tank . oxygen gets in the water because of turbulence at the water 's surface . That 's it , there 's no other factor . and 1 . goldfish gulp air , it 's what they do , and it 's normal 2 . sometimes it 's an indication of poor water conditions which has to do with how you set up , maintain and feed your fish tank , not because of the top . note : proper aquarium hoods have a light and places to cut out for filters . Not a good light , but a light . If you want better then either a glass top is needed , or replacement of the light that comes with the hood . mesh tops can not be cut to fit filters .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403230496000">Hi there ! Honestly it 's a fun idea but if you 've got the top then keep it because the fish will enjoy the light and it helps keep the water warm and the water wo n't evaporate as quickly as it would with the mesh top ! It 's true goldfish ` gulp for air ' so that 's normal but if they 're doing it constantly just make sure you 're doing regular water changes and if it continues get a cheap little air pump , air tube , and bubbler to ensure that the water is oxogen rich for them ! That should fix the problem right up with creating new ones !</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403233069000">Sure you could but why ? Evaporation will accelerate at a very high pace . You will get more household debris in the water .

	<answer epoch="1403818062000">Local breeder maybe .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403818487000">Many people buy teacup dogs because they think they 're ` cute ' but they do require the same amount of care as any other type of dog . If you understand the vet , food and toy bills , plus the time dogs require , read further -LRB- sorry if you do know this already -RRB- ... You could call a Teacup Pomeranian a special breed of dog , and in a sense you would be right , but as far as the breed is concerned , it is a Pomeranian -- just smaller than the average Pomeranian . A Teacup dog is not a special breed any more than a Toy dog is a special breed . A Toy dog is just a small dog . It is one of the classifications the American/ORGANIZATION Kennel/ORGANIZATION Club/ORGANIZATION uses to distinguish among the various breed types and is defined as a breed type that weighs less than 7 pounds . A Teacup dog is even smaller and weighs 4 pounds or less when fully grown . It should be just as healthy as a standard-sized Pomeranian . Many Teacup dogs , when properly cared for , will live longer than most larger dogs , assuming they were healthy puppies to begin with . If you purchase a Pomeranian of the Teacup variety from a reputable and established breeder , the puppy you get will be a purebred . The American/ORGANIZATION Kennel/ORGANIZATION Club/ORGANIZATION -LRB- AKC -RRB- recognizes these tinier dogs for what they are , although they use the term ` Toy ` rather than ` Teacup ` . The AKC lists the Toy Pomeranian as being between 3 and 7 pounds , so a good percentage of those meeting the Toy Standard could certainly be classified as Teacups by their owners or their breeders . Beware the Breeder of Miniature Dogs : There are breeders who will attempt to breed very small puppies any way that seems to work , sometimes to the detriment of the mother , who can be too small a dog to sustain a large litter , or even survive one . A female that is too small may breed a smaller than usual puppy , at least from a statistical standpoint , but may not survive very many litters . How does one actually go about finding a Teacup Pomeranian ? The best way is to try and find a registered Pomeranian breeder who has been able to produce a larger percentage than usual of Pomeranians that grow up to weigh less than 4 pounds . The truth is , even an experienced breeder usually ca n't tell for sure how large a puppy is going to become until it 's reached an age of between 6 and 8 months , but by knowing the track record of the parents , he or she may have a reasonable idea . A genuine Teacup -LRB- remember that the Teacup is nothing more than a definition -RRB- tend to be more expensive primarily because more Pomeranians grow up to weigh more than 4 pounds . It is safe to say that if you see a Teacup Pomeranian puppy for sale that is supposed to weigh no more than 2 pounds when fully grown , you should look elsewhere . You will either end up with a standard-size pooch , or you 'll end up paying your veterinarian to keep your smaller than normal dog as healthy as possible .</answer><suggestions>american/ORGANIZATION kennel/ORGANIZATION club/ORGANIZATION kennel/ORGANIZATION club/ORGANIZATION akc/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403818590000">Anything labeled as a `` teacup '' is a scam . Teacup is not a recognized size classification for ANY breed of dog . Neither is `` micro '' , `` tiny toy '' , and in many cases `` toy '' or `` miniature '' . Only a few breeds actually have size classifications and the Pomeranian is NOT one of them . Official standard for Pom is 3-7 pounds with 4-6 pounds being preferable . Over or under is not terrible , per say , but there are no size terms used to describe these dogs . They are also not intentionally produced by any halfway responsible breeder . What i 'm trying to say is : A three pound Pom is the same as a five pound Pom . Get it ? No reputable breeder uses those terms . Those that do are trying to scam you out of your money so prices will be well over what you 're willing to pay , i 'm guessing . Doubt they 'll come with quality pedigrees or health testing\/guarantee , either . The dogs will just be poorly bred RUNTS . Want a Pom ? Go through the AKC or national breed club and find someone who is breeding responsibly - showing , health testing , the whole nine yards . Or adopt from a rescue\/shelter .</answer><suggestions>akc/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<title>What could be the problem be with my female dog ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I just adopted a 1 yr old female Chihuahua . We got her off someone on Craiglist . We were told that she just was in heat . She is a great dog and we got her for a companion for our 4 yr old Chihuahua\/yourkie when we travel in our mothor home . My male dog had no real interest in her they would lay down together and play but nothing as if she was in heat . The last week the female is acting different . She gets really excited and then she starts putting her butt in the males face and licking at him . We thought that she was just playing . Now the last two days the male had a lot of interest in the female . Licking at her privates and trying to hump her . Well last night she was acting real weird . They both always sleep on the bed usually under the covers on my side of the bed . Last night when I went to find her to put her out before bed she was laying on the floor at the end of our bed and would n't come when I called her . She always comes running for me . Once outside she was fine but as soon she got back inside she went right back to the place at the end of the bed on the floor . When it was bedtime I tried putting her on the bed and even under the covers and she ran right off and laid down on the floor . She spent most of the night there until about 6am she climbed under the covers till we got up . She went outside like usual and went back to the floor again . She is now back to normal .

	<title>Thoughts on Angel Fish eggs not hatching !?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I have a pair of Angels that have spawned 3 times and all three times the eggs did not hatch . The first time was on the filter lift tube which is straight up and down and I blamed the male for not being acrobatic enough to actually touch the egg with the cells he donates . I did not see the act , I can only speculate . I also blamed myself for not having a flat rock for them to use ! So I gave them a rock and instead of using it , they used the plastic outside of the magnetic glass cleaner stuck on the side . Again it is straight up and down and I blamed the male for poor acrobatics . I took the glass cleaner out and then they used the rock and I saw them in the act : the male touched the eggs and coated them with his cells . In about 16 hours I thought I would start to see dark spots of the eyes in the eggs looking back at me , but no , in about two days all the eggs turned white and soon after that , the parents ate the eggs ! I have a trio of Angels in the same tank with the pair . I call them a trio because the two males grew up together and until recently , we thought one of them was a female but when it grew masculine feature such as a head bump we knew even though they had seemed to pair up , I needed to buy a female . I bought a young female and one day I was surprised to find eggs on the lift tube of the filter . Both males were guarding the eggs and they even kept the female somewhat away from them : they acted like the eggs belonged to the two males ! No eggs hatched , why ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401853904000">It is not unusual for Angels to do several `` practice '' runs before successful spawning . Other factors that could account for your problems could be temperature , pH , or water hardness , or just less than pristine water conditions . Make sure your water parameters are up to snuff , and be patient . Another factor might be circulation over the eggs .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
