	<content>I go to a Christian School , They teach us that `` Do n't have sex till your married '' Yet they all did it before marriage . They also say thats its the # 1 `` unforgivable sin '' . NOT TRUE . The unforgivable is not accepting Christ into my heart as my lord and savior .

	<answer epoch="1403827961000">Honestly I think if you love your boyfriend and it 's a mutual love and not him trying to convince you yeah just use a condom .

	<answer epoch="1403828367000">I do n't believe that sex before marriage is a sin , but I do believe having sex without love is a sin . I believe that sex is very sacred and is a way to express a deep love . The main reason that it was thought to be a bad idea to have sex before marriage is so that people do n't have children too young or before marriage or to get an STD . So with that in mind , do what you think is right for you and your heart . I know that if you have your mind set to go through with it , no one can stop you if you are alone with the person you are dating , but before you have sex , make sure you take necessary precautions . You can even pray to God and for Him to help you make the right decision for you because in my opinion , God gave us freewill and He wants us to you it , but it can also be comforting to talk things through with God because He listens to all of our problems and concerns . I would also like to add that you could always wait until you graduate so that if a pregnancy does occur , you can at least have graduated high school especially if you plan on going to college because it is easier to finish college with a child than high school , at least that is the way it seems for people I know .

	<answer epoch="1402315732000">Your statement about menstruation is way off , since menstruation only occurs when the ova is n't fertilized . However , there are many problems with the `` Life begins at conception '' argument : 50 % of fertilized ovum self abort , either fail to attach the uterine wall or , for whatever reason , fail to develop . With such a law we would have to treat every one of those cases as a potential ` murder ' and have it investigated by the police . Or , some forms of birth control do not stop fertilization of the ova , only the attachment of the ova to the uterine wall ; such laws would make IUDs and some forms of `` the pill '' illegal . Or , many women are not aware they are pregnant for several weeks following conception ; if a woman drank alcohol or engaged in other potentially dangerous activities to the fetus before they are aware of the pregnancy , would they be considered criminals ?

	<answer epoch="1403714006000">Black women are ranked the most educated group by race and gender . This is so because out of all the races we are enrolled in colleges more than any other race . You do not hear about this fact because society and the News does not want to focus on the positive things about Black women and our accomplishments so they keep sending bad messages about us on the News , online , the media . Did n't expect a Black person to put you in your place huh ? This goes for jonny/PERSON , southasiangurung , and the rest of the people here with similar comments . Do your research before you ask unintelligent questions , because you are the one looking like you have a small brain . This also goes for the people making bad comments about Black people 's intelligence .

My evidence : one time a black man called me a white twat , another time two black men told me to `` fuck off '' because the street wasnt white territory , one time a black woman said i am a rich white boy who is a `` fool '' because i accidently bumped into her shopping trolley . Do I need any reasons or evidence : No i dont need any reasons or evidence because I just dont like african american people . P.s. i dont care if you guys dont give a shit but its my opinion and it counts .

Those that do go out of their way to insult religion tend to be immature teenagers or young adults who 've become so sure of themselves that they flat out ignore the good things that religion can bring people , like charity , a sense of community , and a set of morals that help many to become better persons .

	<answer epoch="1401933407000">If religion makes ridiculous claims , then it is open to ridicule . Forget Islam . most of those unfortunate to have been born into that foul creed have little choice but to accept the putrid doctrine they are given.The alternative is a gruesome end . Look at your religion , Just as gruesome ; just as abhorrent , But you were lucky enough to be be born into a secular civilization which curbed exactly those atrocities that Islam carries out which Christianity - another foul creed - once did . The difference is that Christianity - no longer having the political power it once enjoyed and which Islam does enjoy , realized long ago that for it to survive , it had to comply to secular morality . That of course does not stop its leaders from still trying to dupe and manipulate the credulous . The atrocities currently carried out in the name of Christianity in Africa/LOCATION are there for the world to see .

	<answer epoch="1401938532000">You can respect people but you should not respect ideas simply because they are held by someone else . You yourself just posted that some beliefs of Islam are abhorrent . You did not say Muslims are abhorrent . What Christians often forget is that non-Christians often find their beliefs abhorrent . Consider a very basic religious belief that could be thought of as abhorrent . Let 's start with Original Sin . What makes this abhorrent is the following : According to the bible all death is due to this first sin . Prior to the sin no death happened . But we know that life existed long before humans and the death is a natural part of existence . If death is natural and it precedes humans then it can not be due to an Original Sin . Therefore Jesus/PERSON was in error . There was nothing to redeem as there was no Original Sin . He was killed for nothing . Ignoring how abhorrent sacrificing a human for the evils of others are , original sin makes people think they are unworthy and bad people without a god . Why would they be bad people ? There is no reason to think badly of oneself . Telling people they are unworthy sinners is evil , in and of itself , as it is an observably false statement . Without Original Sin there is no redemptive death . Jesus/PERSON was n't necessary . The Blood of Christ washes nothing away .

	<answer epoch="1402472247000">This is Christianity : 1 John 1:8 -10 We are sinners who confess our sins and ask for forgiveness anyone who says otherwise is a liar ... James 3:2 we stumble in many ways so we put our faith in the only perfect one Jesus Christ who is able to keep his whole body -LRB- The Christian family -RRB- in check ... 1 John 2:1 and he advocates for Christians when we do sin ... Romans 8:34 as well as he intercedes on our behalf . Philippians 3:12 -14 -LRB- concerning being perfect -RRB- `` Not that I have already obtained all this , or have already arrived at my goal , but I press on to take hold of that for which Christ Jesus took hold of me . Brothers and sisters , I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it . But one thing I do : Forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead , I press on toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus '' . Galatians 6:1 `` Brothers and sisters , if someone is caught in a sin , you who live by the Spirit should restore that person gently . But watch yourselves , or you also may be tempted '' . Hebrews 5:1 -3 -LRB- highlighting weakness leading to sin , not sacrifice -RRB- Every high priest is selected from among the people and is appointed to represent the people in matters related to God , to offer gifts and sacrifices for sins . He is able to deal gently with those who are ignorant and are going astray , since he himself is subject to weakness . This is why he has to offer sacrifices for his own sins , as well as for the sins of the people . It is said , `` Christians are sinners who need Christ '' and it 's never been said , `` Christians are perfect '' This is legalism : Christians must be perfect 100 % of the time -LRB- not Biblical truth -RRB- Once you accept Christ you will never sin again -LRB- not Biblical truth -RRB- If you sin the road back to Jesus Christ may be too difficult -LRB- not Biblical truth -RRB- Christians who sin condemn themselves worse than non-Christians who sin -LRB- not Biblical truth -RRB- Legalists will Deny the Following : Romans 3:28 -LRB- To this very day we maitain that we are justified by faith apart from the law -RRB- Romans 4:5 -LRB- It is God who justifies the ungodly , their faith is credited as righteousness -RRB- Romans 4:13 -LRB- It never has been by the law that Abraham and his offspring received the promise that he would be heir of the world , but through the righteousness that comes by faith -RRB- Romans 5:1 -LRB- Since we have been justified through faith , we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ -RRB- 2 Corinthians 4:18 -LRB- So we fix our eyes not on what is seen , but on what is unseen , since what is seen is temporary , but what is unseen is eternal -RRB- 2 Corinthians 5:7 -LRB- For we live by faith , not by sight -RRB- And this is to name just a few passages concerning faith and the law , but legalists believe that everyone must be spotless , blameless and blemishless every day because they do not realize that only Christ will determine if we are spotless , blameless and blemishless come judgement day through how we 've lived our lives by faith in Jesus/PERSON Chris/PERSONt . Legalists believe that if we sin we are `` Backslidden '' , but this is not a Biblical truth . Our life long journey with Christ/PERSON is not a sinless one , but rather we put our faith in him and in him we will be called righteous and chosen . Legalists are more concerned about living by rules and regulations and what not to do than they 'll ever be concerned with judging what is right and living by it with faith in Jesus Christ where we are all bound to stumble from time to time even while we still press on with our faith and with love in our hearts . Charity covers a multitude of sins , love covers a multitude of sins , faith does the same as well as hospitality , but legalists work hard at denying these facts .

	<answer epoch="1402474055000">. I looked for 15 years for a religious group that actually taught what the Bible says . After repeatedly rejecting the one that God sent to me , because OTHERS said that the people who adhered to it were weird , God finally took pity on me and sent someone to grab my attention ! Oh my , how patient he was with me ! But to my credit , I have to say that as soon as I started to listen to the person he sent , I did quickly figure out all that she said was true .

	<answer epoch="1402474753000">When I was younger , I sinned deliberately . Now , I no longer sin deliberately . The one difference was that when I sought the Lord God with all my heart -LRB- Jeremiah/PERSON 29:13 -RRB- , He did find me . Since then , I have intentionally ascertained a personal relationship with the Lord God and His beautiful Son , Jesus/PERSON Christ/PERSON . There is a huge difference in my life now . I used to be overly outspoken about any topic of discussion , a nasty gossip , very judgemental toward others , and self-serving . Now , I am soft-spoken and no longer resort to arguments regarding any issues , I no longer gossip about anything , am no longer judgemental toward others , and am very grateful ; giving freely to anyone in need . When I read in 1 Peter/PERSON 2:3 -5 , about how the holy women of the ancient past used to adorn themselves with their `` inner beauty '' , I took it seriously and now attempt to live as they did . These changes were not my doing . Jesus gave me these new distinguishing qualities , based upon His teachings . When I decided to follow Him , He gave me His peace , just as He did to His disciples -LRB- John/PERSON 14:27 -RRB- .</answer><suggestions>jeremiah/PERSON god/PERSON jesus/PERSON christ/PERSON jesus/PERSON john/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402598335000">Being certain about one 's belief might not be called faith , I think . No matter what you try to do , there are certain things in this universe that we can not fully comprehend yet we believe in . It is like trying to put all the sand in the beach into your cupped hands . Our brains can only handle so much that we just can not do anything but surrender and believe . I do not need to be sure that the spirits i see when I had my third eye opened are good or bad , or the places I go to when I astral project are still of this world or just a product of my imagination . I just believe them because I believe them . I do not have to be sure but I do believe them . While some will say or ask me that I need to convince them , no need . It is no longer my problem if other people do not believe what I believe in .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
