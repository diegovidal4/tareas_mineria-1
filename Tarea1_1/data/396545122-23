	<answer epoch="1402970382000">The steam generator is a superheated water tube boiler , in contrast to a steam locomotive , which used a fire tube boiler -LRB- fire inside the tubes , water outside -RRB- . The power plant boiler is a huge multistory structure consisting of firebrick , water tubes to absorb heat , burners , and superheater tubes . The superheated steam powers the high pressure steam turbine and the exhaust steam is reheated , and sent to a low pressure steam turbine . The turbine shaft powers a 3 phase , hydrogen cooled generator . The exhaust steam from the low pressure turbine is condensed in a sealed box that is cooled via sea water pipes -LRB- some plants -RRB- . The water is pumped via a condensate pump into feedwater heaters to be preheated before being returned to the boiler by the feedwater pump to begin the process again .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

We have both direct visual evidence of this as well as inferred evidence from periodic increases and decreases in a star 's brightness . Other evidence includes Zeeman line splitting and Doppler imaging . Since sunspots require a magnetic field , differential rotation , and a convective stellar envelope , we can see visual evidence that other stars are similar to the sun . Massive stars have convective cores and radiative envelopes . This generally produces a weaker magnetic field and fewer sunspots . Astronomers have observed sunspots -LRB- well , starspots -RRB- ands sunspot cycles on a few other stars which helps determine the star 's rotation rate and tell us about the star 's internal processes . ...

	<content>If it only has one focus does that mean its not a circle ? I 'm confused about this stuff .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401986579000">In general , if you are given a focus you can not assume that there is only one . Sometimes they give you one focus from an ellipse , even though it has two foci . A circle is a type of ellipse , so technically it has two foci , but they are the same point so it really has only one focus . A parabola always has exactly one focus . = = = = = For this question , you first need to determine the orientation of the parabola . The vertex is -LRB- 0 , 0 -RRB- and the focus is -LRB- -4 , 0 -RRB- . Sketch a quick plot of theses points to verify that these points are horizontally aligned . That means the parabola is horizontal . The focus lies to the left of the vertex , so the parabola opens to the left . The distance between vertex and focus is called the focal length , p. p = 4 General equation of a left-opening parabola : x = a -LRB- y - k -RRB- ² + h with a < 0 vertex -LRB- h , k -RRB- a = -1 \/ -LRB- 4p -RRB- focus -LRB- h-p , k -RRB- Apply your data to solve for h , k , and a.</answer><suggestions>vertex/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401995299000">Well , you \* can \* tell here because you 've been told that the problem deals with a parabola , which , as D. W. stated , always has exactly one focus . By definition a parabola is the set of points equidistant from a point -LRB- the focus -RRB- and a line -LRB- the directrix -RRB- . Since the coordinates of the focus and the vertex are given , we may immediately deduce that the equation of the directrix is x = 4 . Using the squares of the distances , the equation is -LRB- x - -LRB- -4 -RRB- -RRB- ² + -LRB- y - 0 -RRB- ² = -LRB- x - 4 -RRB- ² Expanding and simplifying , x ² + 8x + 16 + y ² = x ² - 8x + 16 y ² = -16 x</answer><suggestions>vertex/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403089173000">Depend on how well `` manifested '' the phenomena is , as they range from invisible to transparent to absolutely solid looking people . The latter WOULD and does cast a shadow . In The `` Wormhole '' or Einstein/PERSON Rosen/PERSON Bridge Theory , a Ghost would be a Living person from another time that we see in a natural `` Bubble connecting another time '' -- provided there is a person inside of it . There is no reason you could not see a shadow . This theory also explains `` ghost '' clothing , props and other inanimate , like `` ghost cars '' `` ghost trains '' , furniture , etc. . A rare parallel universe `` interaction '' would produce Beings '' and objects of DIFFERENT `` densities '' , depending on how close the matter waves from another universe may match our own in such an event . Ranging from transparent to solid , Sufficient density would be enough to cast a shadow . These two `` ghost '' theories Are possible in Modern Physics theory and sufficient to explain the observations and instrument measurements . So they are not actual `` Spirits of the dead '' -- no big deal . When people saw them hundreds of years ago they did not know ANY Science . So `` Spirits '' is just a Traditional `` Folk explanation '' for what they saw . Now do n't be a fool and use `` reverse logic '' like some `` Skeptics '' -- `` The Observations do n't exist because the folk explanation is wrong '' -- The Observations are quite well documented and have been detected and measured . -- Its up to Science to find out what they really are .</answer><suggestions>einstein/PERSON rosen/PERSON</suggestions>

They can also give an approximate absolute indication of palaeolatitude and orientation , but not longitude . 3\/4 -RRB- A hypothesis starts out as an untested idea .

Theory it NEVER proven , however - it is just the best working understanding of something based on the evidence that has yet been developed . Theory can only ever be disproven . 5 -RRB- They sit above mantle plumes 6 -RRB- About 700 km in subduction zones 7 -RRB- Ambiguous question .

	<answer epoch="1401613065000">One at a time dude . 3 . Is a hypothesis a scientific theory that has been tested ? No . A hypothesis is a suggested reason for something that does n't have sufficient evidence to confirm it as correct . 4 . Does a hypothesis develop into a theory if it is repeatedly proven through further testing ? People will argue about this because generally , even among science students , they do n't understand what makes a theory . Although the two words are linked they do n't really have that much to do with each other and they are not different stages of development for an idea . A hypothesis is meant to be a single idea when we do n't know if it is true . A theory is meant to be several ideas which combine to explain something , and it is called a theory regardless of being true or not . We abandon theories that get disproved but they are still called theories , whereas when we disprove a hypothesis is it gone . In general , if true , a hypothesis turns into a fact , a law , a principle etc but not a theory , because a theory is several ideas .

	<answer epoch="1402863013000">15\/16 x 24\/25 : Just multiply the tops and multiply the bottom : 15\/16 x 24\/25 = 360\/400 , which simplifies to 36\/40 and then to 9\/10</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402902694000">You just multiply numerator by numerator and denominator by denominator . In order to simplify , you cancel out numerator and denominator of opposite fractions . For instance : 15\/16 x 24\/25 = 3\/2 x 3\/5 . Notice that I divide 15 and 25 by 5 . And 16 and 24 by 8 . Now you can multiply it . Therefore it is 9\/10 . Hopefully , that helps you .

	<answer epoch="1401619962000">f ' -LRB- x -RRB- = 2x + 6 0 = 2x + 6 -6 = 2x x = -3 f -LRB- x -RRB- = -LRB- -3 -RRB- ^ 2 + 6 -LRB- -3 -RRB- + 10 = 9 - 18 + 10 = 1 So turning point is -LRB- -3,1 -RRB- Another method : f -LRB- x -RRB- = -LRB- x + 3 -RRB- ^ 2 - 9 + 10 = -LRB- x + 3 -RRB- ^ 2 + 1 So turning point is -LRB- -3,1 -RRB-</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401632265000">f -LRB- x -RRB- = x ^ 2 +6 x +10 f ' -LRB- x -RRB- = 2x +6 = 0 2x +6 = 0 2x = -6 x = -3 is the turning point</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401649416000">The turning point is the point at which the gradient is zero . Differentiate the original function : f -LRB- x -RRB- = x ^ 2 +6 x + 10 f ' -LRB- x -RRB- = d\/dx -LRB- x ^ 2 +6 x + 10 -RRB- = 2x + 6 So our gradient is given by 2x + 6 , and we want to find where the gradient is zero . Therefore , we want to solve : 2x + 6 = 0 Which gives us the result that x = -3 . Substitute that back into the original function : -LRB- -3 -RRB- ^ 2 + 6 \* -LRB- -3 -RRB- + 10 = 1 So the coordinates of the equations turning point are -LRB- -3 , 1 -RRB- .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
