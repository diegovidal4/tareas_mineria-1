	<title>Can i bake microbeads in polymer clay ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I have Sculpey polymer clay to make things like donut charms , I recently received microbeads from a friend to use as embelishments on the donuts , but im unsure do I need to bake my clay first then add these , or can I add them right onto the clay and bake it ...

	<content>I recently changed it to a normal toaster oven instead of the amaco one , it would n't rise to temp , I am using a thermometer I can put inside the oven rather then the lil gauges on the oven itself , thank you very much for the help :D your site really helped a lot !</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401940367000">I would maybe say no since they 're plastc and will probably melt . Try it and bake it for maybe 5 minutes and pull it out and check the progress .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402002029000">Most microbeads will be fine baked with polymer clay -LRB- I 'm assuming you 're checking the actual temp with an oven thermometer -RRB- . Most of them are glass anyway , -LRB- I assume you do n't mean the plastic microbeads that are in beauty products btw -RRB- , but even plastic seed beads do fine baking on\/in polymer clay . Various kinds of plastics can take heat from about 200-300F without any problems and many fall on the high end -LRB- remember that polymer clay is a plastic too -RRB- . But usually microbeads will be pressed into the surface of the clay or put in a depression , etc , which buffers the heat as well . You can read about using microbeads -LRB- tiny holeless beads -RRB- with polymer clay on the Mixing Media page at my site if you 're interested : http:\/\/glassattic.com\/polymer\/mixing_media.htm -LRB- click at least on the subcategory called `` Holeless '' beads near bottom of list ... but you might also get some ideas from the `` Seed Bead ' category -RRB- Here are some examples of polymer clay and microbeads if you 're interested : https:\/\/www.google.com\/images?q=polymer+clay+microbeads ... and seed beads too : https:\/\/www.google.com\/images?q=polymer+clay+ `` seed + beads '' .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402944756000">I7 processor is not descriptive . However , I see that you 're on a laptop . Since the i7 on laptops tends to be around 2-3Ghz , that 's the problem .

	<answer epoch="1403756352000">Skill Link Cinccino needs Tail Slap , Rock Blast , Bullet Seed , and another physical move . I gave mine U-Turn . Toxic + Venoshock can be a really deadly combination for Muk . It does work off of its inferior special attack stat , but my Garbodor with even worse special attack was able to use it well . If you go that route , though , replace Sludge Bomb and Minimize\/Mud Bomb . Gathering enough BP to teach it the elemental punches is another option . Wild Charge is great for Arcanine . Replace Heat Wave with that . Mandibuzz is n't necessarily a bad Pokemon , but in B2W2 you have two options for getting one : catch the one on Route 4 , or catch a Vullaby on Route 23 and evolve it . Route 23 is too late in the game to do you much good for anything but the E4 , and the Route 4 Mandibuzz has a terrible , terrible ability .

	<title>why do people mod game consoles ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Why do people like to mod game consoles . I understand one of the reasons is so they can mod and hack games and play them with cool cheats . I will admit that modified games are very cool . I understand another reason is because they like free games . But I was watching a YouTube/ORGANIZATION video with a guy who has 700 PS3 games on a few hard drives . I imagine he downloaded them all or copied them from friends . But still . Who needs 700 games . No one plays that many games . It takes me 3 weeks to beat a game . I mean I do have other things to do than sit there all day playing a game . I imagine people with that many games just have something in them that say `` oh I want to show off my collection to everyone . '' I own about 40 PS3 games . I play at most 4 games a year . I am a movie collector though . I buy about 3-4 movies a week and watch them . I watch about 2 movies a day on week days and some TV shows on the weekends .

	<answer epoch="1402444112000">They mod consoles for the freedom . They restrict you a lot on what you can do with your console . Modding it bypasses these restrictions allowing to to install custom home brew apps . Not every mods their console to hack games and pirate games . It 's all about making the most out of it and pushing the console to it 's limits . It is also an opportunity for small game developers , a lot of small games are made and can only be installed on modded consoles\/phones</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402444355000">The main reason is as you said to play pirated games . I really hate it when people do that . People do it for all different reasons though most of which are for bad purposes , but sometimes people install internal fans and coolers which can be beneficial and I guess can be classed as modding the console . It all depends on what the person wants to mod it for .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402454389000">People mod consoles for a number of reasons . One it the hobby aspect of it . To tweak a system to make it do something it was n't originally designed to do leads to a great deal of satisfaction to the hobbyist . Another is to free the system of pointless region settings of DVD 's . `` Yeah , I bought this DVD in Hong Kong but I cant watch it here ? '' Modded consoles can be made to transfer disk based games to a hard drive . This is about as sinister as ripping your store bought CD\/DVD 's to you Ipod and then shelving your valuable masters . Who is the victim in this ` crime ' ? You bought the disk , why cant you make it so you can listen to a more convenient format ? And then there is the piracy aspect . If you can copy a game to a hard drive , you can send that information or put it on another media and transfer it to another modded console . Console manufacturers are always a step behind the hackers because the hardware is harder to change than the software . Consoles are sometimes sold at a loss , can you figure out why ? A .35 cent pressing of a DVD can retail for > $ 70 . Do you see where the profit comes in ? And they sell millions of these . Just like printers and ink , its the ink that makes the company money .</answer><suggestions>hong/LOCATION kong/LOCATION</suggestions>

Thanks in advance , ~ Saige</content><suggestions>burgh/PERSON eleasa/PERSON saige/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402761634000">Hmm . I do n't know if you 're going to appreciate my suggestions but I can certainly see why Burgh and to a lesser extent Elese would be difficult to handle . The best solution would be to go back to Pinwheel Forest and catch a Tympole . You can keep it instead of Tirtouga if you want , and that would also fix the Rock-type weakness in your future team . At that point there 's one real challenge for your team : Ghetsis/PERSON Hydeigon/PERSON . It 's faster than your Haxorus , resists more than half your team 's STABs and puts a lot of pressure on the only mon to stand a -LRB- small -RRB- chance : Braviary . I can see what you did with the Fire\/Water\/Grass \/ Electric\/Flying\/Dragon-thing . It 's classic , but it 's utterly destroyed by Dragon-types . I always use a Steel-type on every team I make because of this . Dragons are incredibly powerful in 4th and 5th Generation , so I think they 're really mandatory . Your best choices would be either Excadrill or Bisharp . They 're both very good . If I choose to remain on a classic route with a FWG core , I usually use the Steel-type over the Electric-type or the Dragon-type . Replacing the Flying-type could also work , because mules are more fitting for the utility of ` Fly ' anyway , because it 's two-turn . But then again , Fighting-types are also really powerful in Generation 5 , actually on par with the Dragon-types . If you have another strong Fighting-resist you can swap out the Flying-type though . After puzzling a bit you can choose one of these for a better balance : Serperior \/ Zebstrika \/ Chandelure \/ Seismitoed \/ Haxorus \/ Bisharp Serperior \/ Zebstrika \/ Chandelure \/ Seismitoed \/ Bisharp \/ Braviary Serperior \/ Bisharp \/ Chandelure \/ Seismitoed \/ Haxorus \/ Braviary Serperior \/ Bisharp \/ Chandelure \/ Carracosta \/ Haxorus \/ Braviary OR Serperior \/ Excadrill \/ Chandelure \/ Carracosta \/ Haxorus \/ Braviary OR An Excadrill combination with a different Fire - or Water-type -LRB- one without a Ground-type weakness -RRB- A Bisharp combination with a different Fire - or Water-type -LRB- one without a Ground-type weakness -RRB- I hope you 'll manage to find a team you really like among these solutions .</answer><suggestions>tirtouga/LOCATION ghetsis/PERSON hydeigon/PERSON zebstrika/ORGANIZATION bisharp/PERSON zebstrika/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<content>Does anyone know where to buy a inexpensive 3ds -LRB- or 3dsXL -RRB- that 's brand new or is in good condition ? ALSO , does anyone know where to buy a cheap pokemon x game for it that is also in good condition ?

THANKS AGAIN !!!!</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401884735000">If you want to go cheaper , the only option I can think of is getting a 2DS . It 's a 3DS with no 3D ; hence the name 2D . You will be able to play the same games as your friends are playing and get the future 3DS releases you wish to own . Let 's be honest , do you really plan on using the 3D function ? You wo n't be missing out on anything . It 's fancy for a week or two , but after that , you will find yourself switching the 3D off . You will save some nice money for the same exact thing .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Is there a demo version available for Dust : An Elysian Tail ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>A while ago , I picked up a really cute picture from Tom 's Hardware forum , and used it as an avatar on another forum . I put the text `` I have no idea what this avatar is , BUT ITS CUTE ! '' as my personal message -LRB- which appears in my miniprofile next to all my posts -RRB- . Just now , another user messaged me saying that the avatar is named Fidget , the sidekick of the protagonist in Dust : An Elysian Tail . I googled/ORGANIZATION the game title , and the wikipedia/ORGANIZATION article talked about a nice action RPG . Its trailer was also very promising . On the steam page , I found out I needed OpenGL 3.0 or higher . Yeah . I have no graphics card , and that has let to several disappointments . For instance , before I switched to Linux as my primary OS I could always play Terraria with hardware acceleration turned to maximum . Some other things also refuse to start now for some reason . Yeah ... But I want to know if I can run this game on my system without a GFX card . The only good way to find out seems to be downloading a demo version , which didnt seem to exist . If it does not exist , I will probably resort to pirating it , however :3 Still , is there a demo version available ?</content><suggestions>tom/PERSON wikipedia/ORGANIZATION gfx/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403707902000">You can actually buy clear plastic bubbles that you can protect plush toys in and still view them , then hang them from the ceiling like little planets . Failing that , line them up on a shelf and enjoy them while you can . Because the first girl in your life will demand you get rid of them and , blinded by love , you will do anything for her and get rid of your collection forever regretting it . Especially as you find a few years later some were worth quite a bit of money and that b \*\*\* h ruined your life . I mean you made loads of sacrifices but will she get rid of any those shoes of hers ? NO ! will she fu ... oh ... er ... Sorry got a little sidetracked .

	<content>I am one of those guys who love last of us but does n't own a Console , So I was Just thinking that as Last of US came on PS Vita , and I heard rumors about PS Vita emulators on Android\/PC , if someone tried to run a Vita version , Please let me know if this works ??</content><suggestions>ps/ORGANIZATION vita/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403505872000">The Last of Us is n't on Vita . It 's on PlayStation Now which is Sony/ORGANIZATION 's streaming service which apparently the Vita supports . It 's not actually running on the system but on Sony/ORGANIZATION 's cloud servers . There are no Vita emulators and the thing has n't even been hacked yet which makes the possibility of doing so very slim . The quad core processor it has does n't help either . Even if there was one that sort of worked , the possibility of it fully being able to access stuff like the PSN -LRB- which PlayStation Now would need -RRB- is even smaller .</answer><suggestions>vita/PERSON sony/ORGANIZATION sony/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

	<title>Downloading PS4 game to two consoles ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>My brother and I both have a PS3 and now a PS4 in the same house . On the PS3 , what I use to do is , if he purchased a game on his console , he can sign into mine , download the same game and I will be able to play it under my profile on my console . Same thing with Netflix etc. . Can this be done on the PS4 ?</content><suggestions>netflix/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402171252000">It can be done , but it 's more complicated . If you want your brother 's purchases to be accessible on YOUR PS4 , then you have to have your PS4 set as the Primary PS4 for his account -LRB- and vice versa for his PS4 -RRB- . You go to Settings > PSN > Activate as Primary PS4 > Activate . And that 's it -LRB- each account can only have 1 Primary PS4 . So basically whichever PS4 you play on , you have your BROTHER as primary , and your brother will have you as primary -RRB- Do note : Since PS + is required to play online , one of you has to have it .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402171336000">Yes I have both and when I downloaded Netflix on the Ps4 on my brother 's account he did not have to download but you have to have updates seperately</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
