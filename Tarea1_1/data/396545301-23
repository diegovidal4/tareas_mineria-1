If you did , that 's why , if you did n't , they might need to upgrade their discipline to a more constructive , learning based approach . Because it could be argued of course , that solitary confinement was getting off easy , and not really much of a motivational-tool , to make you do better next time -LRB- because you should n't get drunk , it 'll literally hold-back your development , and limit you as an adult -RRB- .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Change in Attractiveness on school trip ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So I 'm in high school and I usually just kind of do my own thing . I 'm known by the class as very intelligent and witty but also rather stoic and silent . I 'm currently working an internship and another job and do n't really have any time for or serious interest in a relationships . I 'm not trying to be ego-centric or anything , but I know I 'm a pretty good looking guy ; I 'm 6ft , 160lbs , and quite lean . So I do get glances every so often , but nothing beyond that . The weird thing was when I went on a trip to France/LOCATION for a week with 3 girls from my school . We were in a tour group with students from a few other schools as well . It started on the flight over when the girls behind me , whom I did n't know at all , kept playing with my hair from over the seat and trying to flirt with me . Then all through the trip the girls from my school insisted on being around me constantly and taking tons of pictures with me . One took to calling herself my bae -LRB- I was n't aware of the term at the time lol -RRB- . I was also asked out to dinner during the trip by a girl from a different school , thoroughly eyed up by a cute French girl at a cupcake shop , and told I have a face you do n't just forgetby a girl . Again I 'm seriously not trying to sound egotistical ; I 'm just trying to recount what happened . I 'm posing the question primarily because I 'm curious as to why I suddenly began being treated so differently from when I was in school . Does anyone have any ideas as to why this type of thing would occur ?</content><suggestions>france/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<title>Was I in a relationship with a narcissistic girl ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I am 27 and my ex is 21 . I have had 3 serious relationships in the past . She has never had a relationship nor has dated . She being a serial party\/club girl has french-kissed 40-50 guys until now . But she never took it beyond that . She said she never had feelings for the guys she kissed and is a virgin . She also said that french kissing is no big deal for her and does n't signify anything . We met in Jan this year through our common friends . On our first meeting , we kissed and made out -LRB- 2 base -RRB- . She took the initiative to contact me later and things kicked off . Initially , she was nice , almost the girl of my dreams . I asked her out , but her response was a stingy ` No ' . I backed off , but later she agreed . Within a month of our first kiss , she raised the subject of a long term relationship , marriage and having kids . I was a bit taken aback , but her love melted me . She also was pro about telling our parents . She gave me gifts , greeting cards , celebrated monthly anniversaries and said sweet nothings and said she wants to be with me forever and I am the one for her . I was never uncomfortable with her kissing history . For me , its an intimate act and doing with randoms w\/o feelings devalues it . On telling her my concerns , she seemed uninterested in understanding where I am coming from . She was n't very empathetic and tried to impress her view on me . I sucked it up , but the matter bugged me and I used to raise it in a harmless way . Her reaction would be neutral to apathetic ...</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>. But , we were also having arguments about unresolved issues from the past . They never were resolved as a discussion led to nothing . Finally , I resorted to merely telling her my feelings and not expecting any comfort or empathy . This made me sad occasionally , which she found unacceptable and annoying . Towards the end , she tried to end twice out of the blue . Everytime she ended , she gave a wide variety of reasons . I had to forget my concerns and attend to this ... .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>By the way , she was never expressive , would bottle her feelings , never showed her emotions clearly , would be close-minded , had a negative outlook on many things and was usually close to new suggestions . It inhibited me from doing and exploring new things as I like to find new experiences . But , I never complained much . By the fourth month , our parents knew , we had updated our fb status and she had posted sweet things about me on fb ...</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I always asked her opinion on any matter and would never impress anything on her . If I ever made a mistake , I would apologise and try to make it up to her . I tried my level best to keep her happy . But , our little differences always created an argument . Although we discussed , it never led to any middle ground , as she would never step in my shoes . It ended in either I bottling up my feelings and sorting it out myself or going her way ...</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>As we moved on , we used to have disagreements\/differences of opinions . My policy is to sit and have a talk about it and find a middle ground . But , talking to her meant that I would be cut off and she would dismiss my views . I realized that she would bang on about her point and if she is proven wrong , she would throw a hissy fit or sit in a corner with a long face . I had to make it up to her and get round to her view . On many occasions , I ended up doing things that she liked and I was ok ... . .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I sat her down and resolved the matters . Even then , her behavior fluctuated between cold , insensitive , apathetic to sweet , loving and warm . She would say that I am the most important person in her life , the love of her life ; but she was ready to end the relationship as she did n't want to settle down in the USA/LOCATION . -LRB- She is from Brazil/LOCATION -RRB- . I was shocked on hearing this , as she we had discussed settling in the USA/LOCATION and she no qualms . Also , she had never mentioned this before ... .</content><suggestions>usa/LOCATION brazil/LOCATION usa/LOCATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403368072000">Update 6 - . Anyways , I thought about it and agreed to settle down in Brazil/LOCATION . I even learned a bit of Portuguese . By this time , she was out of touch with my feelings , needs and concerns . She once behaved rudely with me at a get-together in front of our friends over a cultural debate . I was proving my point with evidence and she was banging on about her views in a loud tone . I saw it fit to end the debate . On reaching home , I drilled sense into her which led to a cold apology and no efforts to comfort me . Her willingness to leave me for immigration reasons had saddened me a lot . I also felt guilty because I had postponed my trip to my parent 's home so I could be with her on her birthday . Due to this , my mum was n't happy as she would get to see me for just 2 weeks after an absence of 1 year . When I said this to her , instead of understanding my mindset , she felt sad and started giving me a cold shoulder . The same day , she bailed out on me , while we were watching a movie , to join her friends at the mall . I got a bit pissed and left for work . I said I would have dinner at the pub so she can have more time with her friends . I went to the pub , had beer and food . I did n't sit at the bar , nor did I flirt with waitresses . I never cheated on her in the relation . When I returned , on seeing me drunk , she was furious as we had made a pact to not drink at a bar alone . I explained that I was n't at a bar , did n't cheat and I drank to blow off my sadness . In fact , I was by myself in the pub . In stead of cutting my some slack , she asked me to move out of her apartment at 1 am and said she does n't want the relation . I asked her to let me stay the night and why she was acting so rude and inconsiderate . She said I am lucky she is letting me sleep here . That hurt me the most . The next day , I woke up , tried to reason with her , but in vain . She was rude , cold , unemotional , inconsiderate and callous in her remarks . This was days after she said I would be with you forever . With tears in my eyes , I moved back to my apartment . Later I met her a few times , I tried to reason with her , begged for a second chance . But she blamed me for the mess , was rude , said that she has no feelings\/love for me , does n't want a relation , does n't think it will work and does n't think the long distance -LRB- once she moves to brazil/LOCATION -RRB- will work . After several days of futile attempts and feeling unwanted , I gave up and said I dont want second chance . I went no contact and erased her from my life . But , I still do n't have any closure . How could a person who initiated the relationship with full gusto ran out of steam ? How could she treat me like this ? And immediately after we ended she was back to her routine - shopping , hanging out with friends , going out , dining out and partying . It 's as if she moved on instantaneously . It 's been 3 weeks now , I still have n't completely moved on . Although , I am far better than fresh after the break-up , I still think of the relation , search the internet for answers and try to find closure . Only recently , I started going out and mixing up with people . I lost 9 lbs in 3 weeks and feel like shite . Out of desperation , I am trying to find answers here . I am sorry about the long description .</answer><suggestions>brazil/LOCATION portuguese/LOCATION brazil/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<content>I have a problem in that I really want to learn to do a lot of things , to paint , to play the piano , to learn cooking and astrology to name a few but my problem is that I am not very persistant , I have so much to say and want to express myself but my skills are n't good enough . I jump around when trying to learn obbsessing for a day or two but not really learning much of anything , then I get frustrated and give up and move on to something else . Its the same with losing weight , if I could just stick to something sensible for 6 months I 'd lose weight and get fitter but I go all out for a day or two and then give up . I get so frustrated that things are n't happening sooner and often end up thinking I am just no good at anything .

I 've been dating this guy for almost a year but if he broke it off I do n't think I would be effected . Also I am very bitchy , and I lie a lot . I do n't feel sorry about anything I 've done . I mean if it effected you it 's not my problem . I am antisocial completely around everyone but who I like . Like if I do n't like the people I 'm around I turn into this smartass bitchy person . I also tend to zone out into deep thought and it freaks my friends out lol . One minute I 'm happy the next I 'm full on pissed off . There 's no in between . I am constantly bored . I 've went through a lot this past year -LRB- my parents split up because my mom switched the gender card hahahah -RRB- I hate my dad . My dad was an awful drunk as I was growing up so I have no respect for him or any adults besides my mother and that 's rarely . I 'm a very strong headed person and I am determined to have it my way all of the time . I lie in my stories to make me sound more interesting and impress people even though I catch myself not caring what others think . I 'm a mess .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

A person can do absolutely nothing with his\/her life and still live happily until he\/she is 100 . People try to be successful in life for three reasons : society , survival , and happiness . Society has formed certain regulations that need to be fufilled in order to seem normal or successful in life . Some people work hard their entire life to be successful because they think they have to . They look at life and think well I have a life , I might as well do something with it . That is where they live for survival . The truth is , if you are completely happy about your current situation and life motives , no matter what they are , you are successful . Living our lives is about being happy and able to do whatever we want at the same time . My advice is to do what makes you happy and dont let these `` rules of life '' control your decisions .

	<title>ANXIETY ABOUT 6 HOUR CAR RIDE PLEASE HELP ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I am 13 years old and in a week my aunt , uncle , and cousins will be visiting . I will be driving with them on their way back to their home , then stay a week there , and fly a plane back by myself . I am nervous about the trip because I have anxiety about having a bathroom around or needing to use the bathroom . When I start to worry it makes me feel like I have to go . I feel embarrassed asking and I 'm scared that if I ask once I ca n't ask again , and that I 'm gon na need to use the bathroom very frequently . I am also feeling nervous about the stay there because I 'm scared of always feeling like I need to go to the bathroom and I am far away from my parents so I do n't want to feel trapped . I do n't want to spend my whole trip worrying about having to use the restrooms and having to use them frequently . I did start recently seeing a therapist about my anxiety but it has n't helped too much so far since I 've only had sessions . Please do n't tell me to wear a diaper or think about medication because I do n't want to do neither . Please give me advice and ways to not be nervous and stay calm during the car ride and trip .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

Idk 3 or 4 people ? They all will have to go to the bathroom once or twoce during the car ride which means you can go to the bathroom with them . Dont be afraid to ask to gonto the bathroom . Or ask if you could stop by a gas station to buy water or a snack and secretly go to the bathroom ! I get car sick and what distracts me is playing with silly putty .

	<title>What are the three kinds of questions that sociologists must ask ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>1 . What is the structure of this particular society as a whole ? What are its essential components , and how are they related to one another ? 2 . Where does this society stand in human history ? What are the mechanics by which it is changing ? What is its place within and its meaning for the development of humanity as a whole ? How dose any particular feature we are examining affect , and how is it affected by , the historical period in which it moves ? ... 3 . What varieties of men and women now prevail in this society and this period ? And what varieties are coming to prevail ? In what ways are they selected and formed , liberated and repressed , made sensitive and blunted ? The question is , what are the three kinds of questions that sociologists must ask and you should write a complete paragraph .

	<answer epoch="1403313196000">The reason you 're confused as hell is because what you are being taught , and the people who are teaching it , are confused as hell . There is no such thing as a `` structure '' of a `` particular society as a whole '' . What 's that supposed to mean ? In fact that is no such thing as a `` particular society as a whole '' because societies do n't exist `` as a whole '' . It 's not like an organism , which exists as a whole . A society is just an abstract concept , made up ofthe actions of its members . A society is not a decision-making entity . For example , take the USA/LOCATION . You 've got 330 million people , each aiming at different goals with different values in different circumstances . Each day lots of people are born , die , move out forever , move in forever , move in and out temporarily , and exchanges goods and services with people outside the USA/LOCATION . Many have closer relationships with people outside the USA/LOCATION than people within . It 's meaningless to say it is a `` particular society as a whole '' . Societies do n't exist `` as a whole '' . They exist because , for each person in a society , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . Otherwise they would n't associate with the others ! If you want to get marks from your examiners , just mindlessly regugitate whatever they say . But if you \* really \* want to understand human action and society , read `` Human Action '' by Ludwig/PERSON von/PERSON Mises/PERSON . It also explains incidentally why what you are being taught is not just confused , it 's nonsense .</answer><suggestions>usa/LOCATION usa/LOCATION usa/LOCATION ludwig/PERSON von/PERSON mises/PERSON</suggestions>
