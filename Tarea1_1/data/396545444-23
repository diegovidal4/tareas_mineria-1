	<title>Speeding ticket officer gave me - she told me she wrote it for a different speed then what I was going . ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So , I was speeding , and this lady said she clocked my going 68 but was going to write it that I was going 64 , yet I still get this huge ticket . The bottom line is that she wrote an invalid ticket , right ? Cause she did n't clock me going 64 ... So if I DO go to court could I easily get out of it ? Or should I just let it go and not look the gift horse in the mouth ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402995836000">In your state there probably is a HUGE difference in the fine , and the points given you between 68 and 64 MPH So this officer gives you a break money wise and point wise and you want to challenge that in court ? You are listening to a lot of Perry/PERSON Mason/PERSON wannabes who are telling you that if you take it to court and tell the judge that you were really going faster than what the officer gave you a ticket for , the judge will throw out the ticket , pat you on the back for being so honest and send you on your merry way . All the judge will do is say something to the effect of `` So you admit you were actually going faster than the what the officer gave you the ticket for < then I will void his ticket and charge you with traveling 68 instead of the 64 `` and increase the fine and points issued . It is up to the officer if he wants to write you for the actual speed or give you a break , and you want to fight it ? Officers give this kind of break daily , it is common practice , judges know about it , and NO DRIVER fights it , because that 4 extra MPH could cost them an additional $ 100 or so , but not you I guess . So go ahead and dispute the speed , admit you were going faster and depending on what the speed limit was , you may talk yourself into a reckless driving ticket .</answer><suggestions>perry/PERSON mason/PERSON pat/PERSON you/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402996144000">Sorry , but you still have a valid ticket . Now retired , I almost never wrote a ticket for the full speed I actually saw . Most Officers will give you some sort of a break like that . The court has a basic fine plus so much for each mile over the limit . The amount per mile goes up at certain levels . Going 20 + miles over the limit would virtually double your ticket in the area where I worked so I rarely wrote for that speed unless the person I stopped was a total jerk . It is true that you can not generally talk your way out of a ticket , but you can talk your way into one when an Officer was actually prepared to simply warn you . You can also talk an Officer into writing for the full amount when they might otherwise be inclined to give you a partial break . The courts are equally influenced by your attitude and you could talk your way into a larger fine but not likely talk your way out of one .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402997403000">You have a couple of great answers here . This is not a ticket you could fight . By the way , the difference between 64 and 68 could be a difference between an ordinary speeding ticket and a ticket that includes reckless driving charges . It depends on the speed zone you was in when you got the ticket . So , consider yourself lucky that the cop is giving you a little break and just pay the ticket . Then SLOW DOWN .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403000260000">Any lawyer will tell you that judges do not take kindly to amateur Perry/PERSON Masons/PERSON thinking they can outsmart the law , especially when the officer gave you a break . Any judge worth his salt would throw the book at you in this situation for being such a smart ` donkey ' .</answer><suggestions>perry/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403009182000">-LCB- If you need a lawyer , you can file court paperwork for a PD . This is income related paperwork .

	<answer epoch="1403012712000">No , you 'll have to use actual law to beat the ticket . Making up and using a cheap gimmick defense like what you described will get you nowhere in court . You have a right to meet your accusers in court . Read your state constitution and see if it says something like that . You had the right to remain silent until you gave up that right . You also gave up some other rights as well . Plus you gave up documents that put you under the transportation code . When you did that , the cop was able to charge you with `` driving '' and `` speeding '' in a `` vehicle '' under the transportation code . Do n't feel too bad , the cop has a loaded pistol on his hip and you were unprepared and nervous . www_logosRadioNetwork_com the Rule of Law program will give you some tips on what to do before you dig a hole and fall into it . There 's some good archived programs . . look for the one 's that say `` Eddie/PERSON 's night '' If the cop does n't show up in court you can get the case dismissed . Unfortunately , they are paid to show up and usually do . Read your state constitution for rights you have and read your state statutes to know what the laws are . Also learn how to challenge jurisdiction before you acknowledge your name in court followed by your motion to put everything on the record , followed by a restatement of your challenge to jurisdiction . Otherwise you 'll waive your right to `` personnel jurisdiction '' `` secrets the police do n't want you to know '' -LRB- good title on youtube/ORGANIZATION -RRB- Some good archived broadcasts at LogosRadionetwork_com are : ROL_2013-02_25 , ROL_2014-04-28 , ROL_2013-04-01 , ROL_2014-01-27 , ROL_2014_01_06 , ROL_2014_03_24 , ROL_2012-12-17 , ROL_2014-05-12 , ROL_2014-05-05 Note : Archived Program Rule of Law ROL_2014-05-19 discussed legal definitions in Illinois/LOCATION for `` Vehicle '' , `` passenger '' , `` transportation '' , `` driver '' at 1:37:45 in the broadcast . `` in commerce '' use of the public road .

<question id="20140605231104AAm8fzJ">
	<title>Can i sue ebay ? Im upset ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Can i sue ebay because they restricted my account from selling on ebay forever because i ended up buying a gucci/ORGANIZATION belt off ebay/ORGANIZATION for $ 130 and it turned out fake the man refunded me and told me to keep the belt , so i posted it on ebay because i didnt want it and then ebay banned me from selling and banned my house address from making a new account on ebay . Heres the problem ... my brother also has a ebay account with 100 % positive feedback and has never gotten in trouble with ebay before ... they also banned his account because he has the same address as me . Thats because we live togather and i tried telling ebay/ORGANIZATION and they said sorry we cant do anything about it ... what should i do ? My brother is upset and its all my fault ... but he shouldnt get punished too ... AND i told them okay im done with ebay delete my account they said they cant delete my account ... whats the point of having my ebay account if i cant sell anymore all i can do is buy stuff but i dont wan na buy stuff because then ill be making EBAY/ORGANIZATION money not me . how much can we sue them for ? And how ?</content><suggestions>gucci/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402035370000">You 'd tried to sell counterfeit goods on eBay/ORGANIZATION , and you knew you were doing it . Heck , the guy you bought it from fully refunded you , and told you to keep it . He knew he could n't legally sell it . Soooo ... you then intentionally tried to scam somebody else ? You deserve to be banned . If you push it , eBay/ORGANIZATION might just turn you over to the police . Maybe your brother can make a new account when he moves and gets a place of his own . eBay wo n't delete any accounts -- they keep records of all transactions . You 're not suing anybody , but you might want to watch it before you get turned over to the police for intentionally trying to scam somebody with counterfeit goods .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402035748000">There 's got ta be more to this story , while the obvious answer is that you tried to sell known counterfeit goods , eBay does n't just ape-shti crazy on you and ban your entire ebay/ORGANIZATION existence without some dialogue in between . By the way - why did you try to sell a belt you knew was counterfeit ?</answer><suggestions>ebay/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402057004000">Sure you can sue if you want to waste a $ 10,000 retainer and the case is thrown out at the first hearing because you agreed NOT to sue eBay/ORGANIZATION in their terms of service . If anyone should sue anyone , your brother should sue YOU . If you have $ 10,00 for a lawyer to sue eBay , then you have $ 10,000 to reimburse your brother for lost sales .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402694017000">Sounds like it 's a civil penalty . Your parents will get a letter from a law firm stating what happened , and that they must pay $ xx -LRB- will be much higher than the value of the item you tried to steal -RRB- . The letter will state that if the penalty is not paid by such date , they have the option to pursue criminal charges .

	<answer epoch="1402694683000">I guess this is a criminal matter punishable by a fine . Minors above the age of 10 , and sometimes 8 if established that he was aware of his acts and omissions at the time of commission of an offense , are criminally liable for their acts and omissions . so the age of seventeen is triable in a court of law like any other criminal .

	<answer epoch="1402183441000">I suspect that Canada/LOCATION is not anticipating being attacked by sea anytime soon , so they have time . My National Security Adviser -LRB- yea , someone who knows but will not divulge classified info over an insecure phone line , especially to a rapscallion like myself even though he is my best friend -RRB- assures me that USA/LOCATION 's nuclear umbrella was designed and continues to function very well to cover defending Canada/LOCATION . All the average American hears about NORAD is when they are tracking Santa Clause . But in reality , trust me , USA/LOCATION knows where everything is and what 's going on . OK , sure , they ca n't track a major airliner made by Boeing because nobody told them to watch it . Ok , sure , they ca n't keep track of 20 million illegal aliens invading America . OK sure , they live under a mountain so of course there are no UFOs , only space junk which , trust me , they know where every nut and bolt traveling at 17 bagizzilion mph is as all that junk orbits earth because it 's a safety hazard . So NORAD would necessarily cover Canada as well because dem pesky Rooskies would have to shoot their ICBMs over the pole to get at US or Canada . So everything 's OK , right ? We , as usual , are always prepared to win the previous war and somehow everyone forgets that the bad guys will do something new . Oh , you know , like for example when Germany/LOCATION invented armored mobility and went through Belgium/LOCATION coming up behind the French Maginot line and those wonderful French had designed fields of fire such that they could n't turn the guns around to shoot behind them , which is where the German tanks were coming from .

	<title>Need Info on the Processing of Assault Charges in AZ ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I was assaulted yesterday , and the assailant was taken into custody on scene , along with video evidence and a written statement of the account . A few hours later , I received a phone call from our local PD that he was being released from jail . Does that mean that charges are not being pursued , that or is it just part of the process ? Because it was the city jail , I could find no record online with more info pertaining to the case</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402692752000">No that means that the person was released somehow , by bond or ror -LRB- released by his own recognizes -RRB- . With assault cases , most time is by either money or property bond . Once a person is out of jail it is no longer public information . You need to call the courts or DA office to see how the person was released and any conditions where attached tot he release as well . And next court\/hearing date , unless the cop gave you one already . The DA will press charges against the guy . Under many state statutory laws , the DA will press the charges even if the victim refuses or want to drop the assault charges . Normally , there is a no contact court order when a person up on those charges gets out on bond . Ask the cop or DA office if there is 1 or not . This means he should have no contact with you in any way shape or form -LRB- including via the social media -RRB- BUT , that means the same for you -- you can not have any type of contact with the person . If the person violates the no contact order , he forfeits the bond and will be sent back to jail . If you violate the court order , it is called contempt of court .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

If a company , for instance , promotes racist ideology in a capitalist society , the people simply stop shopping there if they disagree with that ideology . eventually as no one shops at that retailer anymore , they go away . There are no bailouts in a capitalist system , You either make a product that people want , and manage your money properly , or you fail . if we were actually capitalist , GM would not still be here . Simple as that .

So she asked us for a $ 800 security deposit in advance , and agrees that we can move in at the end of June . But right now , she refuses to rent us the room , we did not sign contract , but she gave us a receipt for the security deposit . Are we allowed to sue the landlord ?
