	<content>My friend got me the game insurgency and when ever i try and load the game and error saying missing executable or unknown error pops up . i have tried many things to fix this . i have even uninstalled 5 times . any fixes ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403325741000">1 . Restart Steam . Sometimes Steam has some weird bugs sometimes for starting games and a quick restart might help . 2 . Verify Game Files . If unsure how to do so , right-click on the game in the Steam Library , click `` Properties '' , after the window pops up , switch to the `` Local Files '' tab on the top , then click `` Very Integrity of Game Cache . '' This will go through the game 's files to make sure everything was installed correctly and nothing is missing . Considering the fact that you re-installed the game around 5 times , this probably wo n't help . 3 . Contact a Steam Administrator . Steam has a strange reputation for actually replying to some of their customers unlike most companies , and if you 're lucky enough you 'll get somebody better to help you than a teenager helping people on Yahoo/ORGANIZATION Answers/ORGANIZATION .

	<title>`` Sometimes '' my computer beeps twice and resets the time . ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I 've been having this issue on and off for the last 3 weeks . It does n't always happen , but sometimes when I start my computer up I get two short beeps and the prompt to continue with F1 or restart . If I choose F1 and continue everything is fine , however my system time gets reset back to January 1 , 2011 at 11:00 AM . My tray icons also become invisible and I ca n't access their properties . I change the time back to what I should be , and restart explorer.exe , which fixes the icons , but only after the time has been fixed . I know that two beeps usually constitutes a memory error , and in most cases one of the main causes is a bad\/dead CMOS battery . However this only happens 1 in 3-4 times , so I seriously doubt it 's only the battery , especially since my computer is only 3 years old , the CMOS battery should last far more than 3 years , there 's one computer at my house where the computer has lasted 10 years on the same CMOS battery . I have never seen the tray icons go invisible when the CMOS gets reset . I have a fair amount of knowledge of computers from IT classes , but I can not figure this out . I half-expect the cause to be something more malicious like a virus in the system root , but I cant find any information online about anyone having this exact problem . Hopefully someone here will have more information .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403766692000">Inspect element has NO control on the page . It is a local tool in the browser . It does NOT bypass anything . These sites are all scams .

	<answer epoch="1403778413000">If it 's the kind of site I am thinking of , it 's not actually a real download site - it never has a real file for you , all it 's there for is to make you fill out surveys . These crop up a lot when people look for the following things , which do not actually exist but people think they do , - 3DS , PS3 , XBox 360 emulators , - Key generators for Steam , XBox Live , - Hacks for online and mobile games , - Also , password files for an archive file containing anything claiming to do the above . You can bypass certain things on genuine download sites , that 's because they are actual download sites that do have some kind of file distribution service . But for example , cleanfiles and sites like that are just scam sites to get you to fill out surveys . You can use various webpage manipulation tools to edit out the survey , but it does n't change the fact that the site is still a scam , does n't let you download things , and does n't have a valid file to begin with .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403569545000">Single card is almost always `` better '' , why would it be better though ? Well it is rather simple . With any type of multi-gpu solution , you will be faced with a long list of possible issues . No scaling , horrible scaling , backwards scaling -LRB- less fps with 2 gpus than with one -RRB- , games that do n't use more than one GPU , and of course the deal breaker for me , crossfire\/sli does not work in window mode at all . I myself play almost all games in window mode , so for me it is useless . The thumb rule is that one GPU is the way to go , unless you want to sit there and tear your hair of when a game does n't utilize crossfire as it should , or when you run to to a game with issues that causes backwards scaling . I would say , go with a R9 290 instead , it 's a better choise . Though it might also be time to upgrade your CPU if you are thinking about high end gpu 's in the future . THe A10 series is really not a high performance platform . If you are going for a crossfire solution now , or in the future . Be prepaird that your CPU will bottleneck it all . Also there is no reason to have a 1100w psu , 700w is more than enough to run two R9 270 .</answer><suggestions>gpu/ORGANIZATION gpu/ORGANIZATION gpu/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>

It said that it could convert my videos to a formal compatible with iTunes , vut it still does n't play there . I have now downloaded QuickTime and some codec along with it and still , my video can not play there at all . I can watch it fine on Windows Media Player though . What should I do so that i can somehow have these videos on my Ipad ? P.S when i connect my Ipad to my computer , it does not charge . Has it not been able to identify my laptop or something ?

	<answer epoch="1402748127000">Quote : - - - Starting with Windows 8 , the DirectX SDK is included as part of the Windows SDK . We originally created the DirectX SDK as a high-performance platform for game development on top of Windows . As DirectX technologies matured , they became relevant to a broader range of applications . Today , the availability of Direct3D hardware in computers drives even traditional desktop applications to use graphics hardware acceleration . In parallel , DirectX technologies are more integrated with Windows . DirectX is now a fundamental part of Windows . Because the Windows SDK is the primary developer SDK for Windows , DirectX is now included in it . You can now use the Windows SDK to build great games for Windows . - - - - - WinSDK Direct Download - > http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/click\/services\/Redirect2.ashx?CR_EAC=300135395 Source - > http:\/\/msdn.microsoft.com\/en-us\/windows\/desktop\/aa904949 Hope it helps : -RRB-</answer><suggestions>sdk/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402748266000">go to http:\/\/www.microsoft.com\/download\/en\/search.aspx?q=directx Click the link in the search results named DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer or DirectX End-User Runtimes -LRB- MONTH YEAR -RRB- . Note : Typically , the DirectX End-User Runtime Web Installer link will be your best option since it 's the latest release and only installs the DirectX files you are missing . Some users prefer to download and install the entire DirectX package by choosing the DirectX End-User Runtimes -LRB- MONTH YEAR -RRB- link with the latest month and year available . Note : The DirectX SDK download options are not recommended . Complete the DirectX installation by following any directions from Microsoft 's website or from the DirectX installation program . Note : This DirectX download will install on Windows 8 , Windows 7 , Windows Vista , or Windows XP . Whatever files are missing - be them DirectX 11 , DirectX 10 , DirectX 9 , etc. - will be replaced as necessary . See Tip # 1 at the bottom of the page for more information about DirectX in specific versions of Windows . Restart your computer , even if you 're not prompted to do so . After restarting your computer , test to see if updating to the latest version of DirectX corrected the problem you were having . Or there is one more simple method instead of going through these tedious steps . If you have any PC games -LRB- fifa , farcry , nfs so on -RRB- install it they will automatically install directx . .</answer><suggestions>microsoft/ORGANIZATION fifa/ORGANIZATION nfs/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
