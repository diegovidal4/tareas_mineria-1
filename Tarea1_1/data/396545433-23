	<title>Was I too clingy ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Me and my ex were in a long distance relationship . Apparently when she broke up with me she felt i was too clingy . Once I had jokingly asked her something about future kids , She freaked out and I told her I was joking but I was sorry . Never did it again . A couple other times I mentioned trying to get a job in her city and she said she was happy I was considering her in my future but she did n't sound happy . I would call her babe and ask her how her day was going . And almost every night I would say `` good night , love you '' but I also had my own life so I was n't texting every 10 minutes or anything . I say we would have one or two text conversations a day never going for more than 15 minutes . And I only had 300 minutes per month for my phone bill , that 's only 5 hours for a month btw and we would run out with a week left of the month . When she started acting distant she said she could n't put forth the effort I waas and she felt bad . I tried to break up with her right then but 5 days later she pulled me back and strung me along for 2 more months . She told me I was such a caring and wonderful , perfect boyfriend and that my voice `` calms and soothes her '' but does n't want a relationship , needs to mature , and that I was n't `` right '' for her . I do n't understand . I tried to be affectionate and caring but at the same time not be overwhelming and I did n't think I was . I have n't talked to her and it 's been a month since the breakup . What do I do to get her back ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402537244000">You were not clingy . Three things that are possible : 1 . She met someone , but never told you 2 . She got `` disconnected '' bcause of lack of seeing each other . 3 . She does n't know what she wants , or she just prefers to go out and have fun instead of being settled Leave her be , and find someone who really wants to be with you .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Does he like me or what ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Does he like me ? Why does he seem more comfortable around me now ? is it because I touched his arm ? I know him about 2-3 months . When I was talking to this guy he was explaining something workout we were standing side by side close , my arm brushed against his accidentally I could feel the hairs on his arm he did n't move his arm away just left it there ? continued talking I moved mine away slowly after a couple of seconds . He afterwards moved in closer and moved his arm nearer almost touching just close that you know it 's there . We always stand extremely close to each other like in a intimate closeness . Ever since I touched his arm he seems more comfortable , talkative around me . The next time I saw him we ended up talking about our weekend then for long about movies . Usually he 'd be quieter we 'd both not really say much to each other he 's a confident guy different with everyone else talkative quieter with me . . During sets he asked me about if I was a student , what age I was , where I was from . Asking all about me took him 3months to ask me this . We spoke about world cup . He was joking with me a lot telling me stuff . He 's my trainer he 's done other flirty touching like he got me to touch off his hand . At the end he 'd come in closer pat my shoulder smiling each time . Usually for that particular exercise he 'd just tell me how far back to go with my hand . . He 's started complimenting me with `` beautiful '' or `` thats beautiful '' instead of his usual phrases .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402960490000">Well what I would say that he definitely likes you but he is probably trying to take things slow because some relationships can be like that maybe it 's because he ca n't tell if you like him or not try to give a sign do n't ask me out but ask if he wants to hangout like going to the movies</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403693362000">If you have any pictures of you and him -LRB- and some time -RRB- make him a video game themed scrapbook . You can buy a book and things to decorate with from the store and then work on creating a book . Or if you do n't have that much time maybe get him some sort of game or at least a card .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403694403000">Honestly , do n't give him a video game , once he 's done playing the game it 'll get shelved , or traded into game stop or he 'll just stop playing it and forget about it . This may sound cheesy , but tons of friends do it : get him like a key chain , or something simple . You do n't have to spend a lot of money , but just something to remember the fun times you 've had together . They could be matching key-chains too . Honeslty , out of all the gifts my friends have gotten me , it 's the little , simple ones that hang around the longest and remind me of them . It could help to be something useful , like a beer bottle opener key-chain , or a little knife . It does n't have to be much , just something easy to keep around to remind you two of your friendship .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>How are they committed to each other when they have sex with other people ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I 'm 22 and my ex is 28 . We dated for 2 years and lived together . He went through a hard financial time where I lost 4 thousand dollars helping him , and then he cheated on me . He said he was sorry and was going through a rough time , but never showed it . It made me lash out constantly and he left me for the arguments when he knows I was trying to fix things . Last month he started dating a dominatrix . She 's polyamorous because of her job -LRB- which is disgusting looking at her photos -RRB- . I went about doing my own thing for a month , then a few days ago he was asking me to come over and have sex with him -LRB- I did n't -RRB- He says they 're committed to each other , but `` sex is just sex '' and I REALLY just do n't understand it . Then told me how amazing she is . But I still feel like I did something wrong because he seems completely in love with this girl and he was n't with me . How can I move on convincing myself it was n't my fault , but just the fact that he wants this lifestyle ? I can tell myself it all day long , but at the end of the day he 's still more into his new relationship than he ever was with me and it still hurts me .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Just a side note : It was never just sex with us . We 'd only have sex a couple times a month even after sleeping in the same bed with him every night . So he was n't after me for just the sex .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402953713000">Of course you did n't do anything wrong , obviously you two just were n't right for each other . Maybe he did n't know he wanted this lifestyle until he met someone within the community . He did do wrong when he cheated on you , though . So I 'm not sure why you 'd want to stay in touch with him right now , you need time to get over this and heal . -LRB- As a side note , the dominatrix girlfriend is n't polyamorous \* because \* of her job . Being poly is a sexual identity just as being gay and straight is . But polyamorous people get more acceptance in the BDSM community , which is simply way more open to different sexual identities . -RRB-</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402953790000">For some people , sex is just sex . Usually more for guys than women . Women associate sex with feelings , emotions . love . Most guys associate sex with feeling good . I know you feel bad about him not loving you like he obviously does you but try not ot let it get to you too much . Obviously , he was n't the right one for you . You can do so much better . There is someone out there that will love you for you and want to have sex with you because he loves you not just because he wants to feel good . Because Mr. Right will feel good and want to be with you and the sex will make him feel good because its U not just because its sex .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402953966000">He 's into this relationship more because he can sleep with others and get away with it . Think of it that way . He is obviously not a good guy to be with . He is not stable . Him cheating is not your fault so do n't blame yourself . I would just tell him how you feel , cut contact with him for a while , and move on . Him having a rough patch is no excuse to be cheating . Not trusting someone that cheats is ONLY natural . If he did not want the arguements , he should n't have cheated .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402954940000">duh he was after you for sex and money how long will it take you to realize that</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402956838000">First of all , why are you still communicating with this jerk ? him ? How can you fault yourself for what kind of lifestyle a grown man wants ? No he was n't after you for just the because he was probably dating a dominatrix under cover while he was with you . He did n't leave you because of the arguments , he left because he wanted to . Everybody in a relationship has had arguments , but if you love each other , you get over it . You should have left him after he cheated on you . You spent your hard earned money on this man , he still cheated on your and then left you . Pick up your self-esteem and confidence and get this man out of your life . While you are comparing your relationship to his new relationship , you are ignoring the unique values that you have . Not going over to have sex with him shows you are strong woman , so do n't worry about If you did something wrong or not . You did n't need his money , he needed your money . You did n't cheat on him , he cheated on you . Stop thinking about him -LRB- I know it 's easier said them done , but you can do it -RRB- and go on to live your life to your potential . Think about the things that are really important to you and what you want out of life . Good luck and just remember , you can do better . When you think about him , it should be with disgust .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Another child I never knew my husband had ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>So me and my husband have been together for over 5 years when we met we told each other about our children from previous marriages I have 2 he has 2 as well . When we met we fell deeply in love and he was no longer with his ex . I know this because he was always with me we would see each other after work and I know he has n't been messing around . Well I do n't know his babys mama I have never met her and I have always been curious to know what she looks like -LRB- please dont judge -RRB- . I do know his 2 kids which I love so much and my kids love them as their brothers . Well a couple of days ago I was on my FB and I typed her name just for curiosity , and I found her I knew it was her cuz in the pic was also my stepdaughter I saw her pic and I saw another boy that I have never seen or heard before , caption said `` my family '' so I confronted my husband about it . I asked him how many kids you have with `` this girl '' , his face said it all and my worst fears became a reality . He says she got pregnant months before we met and he says he is not sure is his cuz she was going out a lot without him , but by looking at the pic it 's clearly his . I 'm broken hearted and I feel like a damn home wrecker , I would have never been with him knowing there was a child on the way . This kid has no fault to the situation his parents put him through . I love my husband so much but the lie it 's so much bigger , I do n't know what to do he has always been there with me and for me and my children too .

	<answer epoch="1403377491000">He has lied to you but you have a family together now that you have to put first ! He has n't cheated on you , this is before you were together .

	<answer epoch="1403378249000">He is a liar and I 'm sure if you spoke to her some more truth will be brought to life real love would have told you that there was possibility I 'm sure when you shared the good bad and ugly you left no stone unturned and you deserved no less as adults you all should be able to sit down so everyone can have answers and as a stepmom you must be able to have a relationship with them to continue to foster the relationship between them and their dad</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403379385000">The fact the ex is not sending the kid to visit with the other two tells me she knows he may not be the father . That does not cure the fact he failed to mention there maybe a 3 rd kid , but does give him creditability to thinking that child is not his . My advise would be to ask him if he thought about a DNA test , in order to put the childs best interest first , and see what he says then . As for being a home wrecker , you may feel like one now , but it was NEVER your fault they split up . You did nothing wrong . If he was not with you , he still would not be with her , so it was over no matter if you dated\/married him or not .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403380163000">He has another child . This is not about you . The children come first . Since all five of the children involved have had parental instability , you are obligated to try to work things out with your current husband . Your jobs are to nurture all the children , no matter who the parents are . Your husband lied to you , so he must rebuild your trust in him . You were sneaking around spying on him . So you must rebuild the trust he has in you . You both will have to try let go of what has happened and move into the future providing as much stability as possible for the children who it sounds as if you love .

	<title>Why do exes play mind games ?</title><suggestions>mind/PERSON games/PERSON</suggestions>
	<content>My ex dumped me and said he wanted nothing to do with me and because I did n't see this coming initially I did the dumb thing and begged for him back . He told pretty much anyone who would listen about how bad I was , whether it was neighbors , or people at work . Fast forward now , he has been contacting and not talking about getting back together , but wants me to help him out . I sent him a text last night saying that unless he is calling about our son , please dont contact me . He didnt take that very well . He wants to be on friendly terms , but he did a cowardly thing . He had already planned on leaving me and already went apt hunting etc and is now in a hotel . I can never forgive him for this . As of lately he called me and asked me if I called him . I told him no , he then said someone from my number called and I was like no the phone has been on the charger the entire time . Just to be sure no one called him , I checked the call history and there were no outgoing calls . Now he needs me and I dont want to be used . Why do some men play mind games ? He went from treating me like absolute crap to know wanting to work with me . Of course this working with him is not about getting back together , but making his life easier . He got a night shift job and needs someone to watch our child in the day . The thing is that we have an agreement where he gets him for a wk and I get him for a wk . Therefore I have to pay daycare 2 wks out of the month and so does he .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>The thing is that if right now he got a high paying job where he could afford daycare , he would not be trying to work with me . Now he wants me to watch out son at night and he watches him in the day so we both for go daycare costs . The problem is that I can not trust and when I proposed this idea he accused me of being co-dependent and using our son to get him back . However now he is proposing the same ideas 2 wks later .</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403461575000">Firstly he is n't playing mind games . . he 's trying too but you 're too smart for that ! You can see what he is trying to do and you 're not allowing him to ! So be proud of yourself ! Typically when people want to be ` friends ' and want help from their exes it 's because they want to keep them in their lives as a back up . Just incase nobody else wants them or as like a comfort blanket . It sounds harsh but i had to learn that from my ex too . You deserve better ! He has proved that he is n't worth the love or trust to be back in your life . he is n't worth the answering of the phone or the time and effort really . Things become more tough when you share a child but he has proven that he is a bad role model as a father so do n't feel bad about blocking him out . as far as you 're concerned , you 're both over so you need to set ground rules . he needs to ONLY contact you regarding your son , if he tries to bring anything else into the conversation , abruptly say you 're busy -LRB- nonchalantly -RRB- and hang up !

He may or may not find someone that does or does n't love him but the fact will always remain that as long as he is abusive then it is that he has little respect for love .

You can find happiness , I did . Hopefully , the next woman he meets will kick his ass or have him put in jail . He does n't know how to love . Love does n't hurt . When I first heard that , I did n't believe it but now I know if my husband loved me he would n't have hurt me . He had a mental problem . So do most abusers . You ca n't help them . So help yourself , love yourself . You are a beautiful powerful loving person . Believe it , live it . Be good to yourself . It will take time to heal but you will . When you meet someone and there is anything that they do that you do n't like , jump them . Its better to be alone and happy then to be with an ass who makes you feel worse .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402035013000">Block him on all social media , change your phone number , and only give it to people you know you can trust not to give it to him . Do not answer any messages or texts he send you in the meantime.Everything he does and says will be to pull you back in where he can control and abuse you . Seek help , and talk to a professional to get past the abuse . The bottom line , remember , he did what he did because he decided he wanted to , and thought you would never leave , not because you deserved it . It made him feel in control , and better about himself to abuse you , meaning he has low self esteem and can not cope with life and reality on his own , unless he has someone to hurt . You are worth more then that , so never , ever go back .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

Rather than concerning yourself about neck kissing , you should first see if he likes you in the first place . If he does , you 'll probably make out with him at some stage . At this stage ; you first kiss his neck . Then he will likely follow by kissing yours in the next few times you kiss . If not , then ask him casually about it .

	<content>We 're in our late twenties . We have been together for 9 months . We have had a lot of fun times together , always laughing and having fun . We go on weekend trips , to the mountains , hiking , to the beach , movies , dinners and always have fun . He asked me to move in with him last month , with a move in date of 6\/20 . I told him last wk that I needed to take a break to think about whether I wanted to move in . My 23 year old sister passed away in a tragic accident in September and I wanted to stay at home with my family at a place where her and I shared so many memories . I told him after only 2 days of thinking that I would move in with him . The next day we went to the beach and had a great time.Then we went out last night and had a great dinner . This morning he told me that because of my anxiety he needed to think about whether or not he wanted to be with me since family is important to him and he wants me to constantly attend social events with his family which is hard for me because I 'm an introvert . He told me `` I let you think last week , now its my turn '' . He said he loves me but he needs to be in this 100 % or not at all and he does n't know if he can live with me being an introvert . I packed up all my belongings at his house with tears in my eyes and he continued with his morning routine un-phased , no tears , nothing . He even offered me a box .

For example , you would decide together what to do about your sister 's tragic accident and about the social events with his family . You would take on these decisions as a bonded couple that has each other 's best interests at heart . Living together is more like playing house than actually building a life together . I do n't recommend it ever . Sorry that you have had to face so many difficult situations in the past few months . Life is so sad sometimes .

	<answer epoch="1402151674000">I can honestly say such a situation is fairly difficult to tolerate . My suggestion is to simply avoid these people and gradually migrate to another social group , rather than be blunt . Try not to provoke them , as they evidently sound like menaces . To summarise , do not make it obvious that you 're leaving their circle-be discrete . If you 're stronger , smarter , and more popular than them , need n't worry , a `` punch in the face '' should n't be necessary . Often bullies of this sort recognize they 're weaker and purposely attack helpless victims to boost their poor self-esteem . I understand it 's somewhat awkward , but if you 're brave enough to retaliate this behavior by simply talking to them , feel free to do so . Before taking action , ensure you have another social group that you feel comfortable with . How severe is their bullying ? Provided it 's not physical , you should n't have to worry . Once you leave their group , there 'll be other friends waiting for you , ready to support you if they decide to target you as their new `` victim '' . At any rate , do not be physical , as it will provoke a war . Best of luck , mate .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>How To Give Space without Pushing Away ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Hi and thanks for reading . My girlfriend and I have been together for over 10 months , and we 're both in our late 20 's . We had a very intense 2-3 month beginning to our courtship : very physical , emotional , spent all our time together . Since then , things have slowed down but I am still crazy about her , in fact I think about her all the time and probably too much . The months following our ` honeymoon phase ' gradually became a bit lackluster to me : barely any intimacy , affection , physical touch , but I knew she was still in love with me and I was very in love with her . Now , for the past couple months , we 've really been doing a lot better , but it took some heartbreak for us to get there . She kissed a random dude when she was on vacation last month , and although it was a completely unemotional kiss that ` meant nothing ' to her , it really hurt me . To her , she said it was the catalyst that she needed to start really trying to make us work . I am in the process of trying to forgive , and in many ways we are even stronger now . I feel that the one thing I need to do to continue with her is to figure out a healthy level of interest . In short , I feel ` stuck ' in the honeymoon stage where i 'm enamored all the time , I want to shower her with affection and love , and she 's reached a different phase . But , I want her to crave me like she used to , and I do n't think I 'm going to get there with my current attitude . What can I do to make her swoon again , without pushing her away ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402418609000">This sounds almost exactly like the relationship I have with my boyfriend , but we have been together for over three years . I go through my spurts where I really just want to have some space . But after I get over it , we end up right back in the honeymoon phase . And it 's a never ending cycle which is completely normal for most couples by the way . What I would do is give her the space she wants , while allowing yourself some time to forgive . It 's a compromise of sorts , she gets what she needs , and so do you . After you really feel that you 've forgiven her , then show up at her house or workplace with a bouquet of flowers or chocolate , whatever she likes , and take her out to a surprise lunch . That 's what my boyfriend does for me after giving me the space I need , and it works every time .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Does this girl think I 'm unattractive ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>About a week ago my so called friend who is a girl was describing me to her other friend at a party and from what a guy friend told she said `` I 'm the guy with the belly . '' Then the other night she told the girl I 'm talking to that she could do so much better then me . It 's funny cause this girl literally never says anything to my face negative and we always seem cool , but these two instances just have me wondering what she really thinks about me .</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403052483000">Wow she seems like one of those hypocrite bitches who smile in your face and talk sh!t behind your back ! I think you should just leave her . A friend who tries to push girls away from you is not a friend for sure . Or maybe she 's jealous maybe ? You better find out .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>I have n't heard from my boyfriend in a month ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Me and my boyfriend have been dating for 3 months and he lives an hour away . Well we text everyday , but I texted him about a month ago and never got a response . I called him , and no answer . He sent me a text 3 days later from a weird number saying that he loved me and to not text this number back , so I did n't . That was June 1st , and that was the last time I heard from him ? I just assumed we were n't dating anymore , so I 've been talking to other people . I feel bad for it , judging that we never officially broke up . What should I do ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402958713000">Maybe he wants to break up but he feels like he would upset you if he actually told you . This is pretty common , but maybe it can be something else like he lost his phone or whatever . Best of luck to you !</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>Found boyfriends name on porn site ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I typed in my boyfriends username out of curiosity . . I found a site called xprofiles.com and his username is there . His location is different and the account says a year younger than him . I 'm really paranoid about it as it was made on the 7th June . I confronted him and he said it 's not him and that he would atleast use a different name if it was ! So confused . The name is scottyboii 95 maybe there 's others who use it , I do n't know . I ca n't stop thinking about it : it 's a cam site . That 's why I 'm bothered . Anyone know anything about xprofiles.com ? Is it genuine ?

	<title>How do I convince my parents to let me try contacts ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I 've already tried to talk to my parents about it , but they have an extremely difficult attitude , and therefore also adamant . I 'm here to hopefully get some useful advice from you brilliance folks here at Yahoo Answers . Whenever I want to change , they always procrastinate , complaining about how there is so much hassle to go with within that change . They not only procrastinate with my wants , they also do it to themselves , things like eating healthy and exercising are virtually absent within most of my family . This pattern has been constant for a long time , and I really can not wait until I turn 18 and escape ... but until then ... The pattern always goes as 1 -RRB- a simple change but appears complicated 2 -RRB- disagreement from parents 3 -RRB- attempt to convince , usually concluding in A -RRB- denial B -RRB- delay C -RRB- accepted . Getting to C already proves difficult , I have to be consistent . Examples of this pattern are when I started growing facial hair and my parents would n't let me shave it , or when I wanted to purchase books online and they were skeptical . Eventually , after months of occasional asking , they agreed . The problem is , they are n't budging . They fear the unknown . I have already contradicted the myths like : `` you 're too young , it will infect your eyes , '' etc. etc. , but hell , it looks like I need external assistance . My parents will get crazy and stressed whenever I bring this up , so please consider that when you answer . I look forward to your responses .</content><suggestions>yahoo/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401666232000">Contacts make your eyesight go down slower than glasses . It is also more convenient to watch a 3-D movie with contacts . It does n't matter what age u get contacts . As long as u know the proper procedure of it and do it right u can get contacts . For example , u must wash ur hands every time u take out or put in contacts , u must not go to sleep with contacts . Contacts do bother ur eyes when u start out and sometimes it makes u feel a pain in ur eye . If u get contacts , it 's recommended for the daily ones that cost around $ 200 plus tax per month depending on the optician u go to .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<title>I do n't understand what my ex ´ s intentions are . he 's a pisces . ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>Ok a month ago , my bf and I broke up after 3 years together . He texted me on a Friday and said that him and his kids were n't happy . I freaked out and cried , cried , cried . Of course I texted him every minute asking why he would just leave like that . Ok about a week went by and I just wanted to see him , so I would ask him for sex cause I knew it would work and it did . The sex went on for about 3 weeks . While he was with me , he would hold me and kiss me and tell me how much he really loved me but could n't come back because his daughter '' who is 13 '' did n't want to come back , because she wants her daddy . He told me if it was up to him then he would come back , but his kids come first . I have 4 boys of my own that he just up and left . But anyways , everything was going slow but good . All of a sudden he just stopped taking to me . It 's been 3 days since he talked to me . This is my second day of not texting him . The big thing I do n't understand is , why does he still have the house key , has n't come to get his things , he let me keep the car , he is paying my electric , satellite bill , and he still is paying the car insuranc , but he says he do n't think we are going to work . He 's giving me so many mixed signals it 's unreal . I do n't know what to do . I love him and I want my family back . Oh and he moved in with his mother that lives right down the road from me . He has a great job and works 12 to 14 hours a day . He 's 38 years old . He 's been married twice and I 'm only the third woman he 's been with</content><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403024191000">hey misty , It sounds like your going through a really tough time at the moment right ? my first assumption would be that he is concerned for his children . have no doubt you were great with the kids , but sometimes having another adult in the home can have its difficulties . Id suggest giving it a bit of time , see if the children and the thirteen year old will come round to you . perhaps you could offer to take them on some days out ? meet up with your ex boyfriend , have a chat about what went wrong in the relationship . i think he still obviously loves you but he probably just does n't know how to tell the kids . my advice would be to leave him be for a while . believe me , you do n't want him thinking that your needy . then he really will be reluctant to get rid of you . I know how hard it is as I myself have been through a divorce , however try to get on with your life perhaps take a vacation abroad somewhere if you can afford it ? take some me time , and I am sure things wont seem quite so bad . also , if you really do love the man , fight for him ! do n't be weak . just give him some time and then do n't ever take no for an answer . be a complete utter bitch if you need to ! hope I helped -LRB- a bit ! -RRB- god bless Nicole/PERSON x</answer><suggestions>nicole/PERSON x/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403024252000">I respect the kids choice n if it was your kids who dont want him I would respect that too . What I do n't understand is why he has to ignore u. He can live in separate house but still talk to u n see u. May be he is seeing another girl behind your back . I do n't trust people sometimes . He is still paying the bills because he is shy to cut off like that . May be he will change soon n delay to pay . Do n't rely on him be prepared n when that day comes , let him go . I blv when one partner decides to move out it occurs to me that he been thinking about it for a while . Kids might be a cover story behind the real problem . Engage him into talks n ask him to be honest . Its better that u get ready for wat is coming . It looks like that guy is now coming for sex just . 3days is a lot with no word . Good luck darling !</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403024288000">Friday night I looked it the window and he was driving by my house real slow . I know he 's jealous and I know he still loves me . I know he will not hurt me , but this is making no sense to me . It 's driving me crazy .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403024413000">I think you need to detach and disentangle yourself from this man . Ask for your key back , take your bills back over and start paying them yourself . Tell him to come get his things -LRB- Better yet , when he comes have them packed and ready on the porch to make the retrieval process as painless as possible -RRB- Ask if he will sell you the car . A 13 year old daughter of a divorced father can wield a lot of control , and as he stated - his family comes first . You can not get him back with sex and I think you 've discovered that tactic did n't work and only made you more miserable . Remember you already have a family - your boys . They deserve to have a man in their life who loves them and you equally . Sounds like this guy is a yours and mine kind , and never considered anything `` ours '' . Move on and find someone else . -LRB- And three years down the road , when his daughter is 16 and full of her own life and interests with little time for him , he 'll probably be regretting letting her make his life 's decisions . Karma will come to him in kind . -RRB-</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
