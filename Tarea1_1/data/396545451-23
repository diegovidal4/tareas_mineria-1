	<answer epoch="1401913172000">There is really no need to . The sea is rising by 3 mm\/year . That equates to about 1 inch a decade . So we are literally talking about hundreds of years to cause problems with buildings that are not so close to the sea that they already have tidal concerns . How many hundred year old beach houses have you been to ? The warmers try to talk about the real estate cost by assuming steady state . Economics changes the pattern of where people live far faster than this . Also the 10 feet rise is complete hooey . Since the LIA -LRB- Little Ice Age -RRB- the seas have been rising by about 1-2 mm\/year . Meaning with all of the scary-scary global warming , the increse in sea rise has only been about 1-2 mm\/year over the last 100 years . They are trying to say that the sea level rise will increase by 30 mm\/year in the next 86 years ??? I do n't think so . Their assumptions are the most assinine ever . They assume steady state in where people live -LRB- which is obviously not true -RRB- then they assume exponential increases in everything to do with global warming , even though they use LINEAR regression to model the past .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401913748000">Just plain stupid . The `` added depth '' you mention is not real . Digging around the coast line will not remove enough material . You need to remove material from the ENTIRE OCEAN FLOOR to offset a rise in the ocean . Just build dikes and levees . You ca n't dig out the entire ocean .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1401923778000">If the arctic sea ice melts it does n't make that much difference , since it 's already displacing its weight . If Greenland/LOCATION or Antarctica/LOCATION melts , it will raise the ocean much more than ten feet . But let 's assume that it 's just going to rise ten feet and that 's what we want to work on . Do you know how big the ocean are ? You want to increase the ocean depth by ten feet -- we will call it three meters . The area of the ocean is on the order of 350,000,000 square kilometers , or 350,000,000,000,000 square meters . So you need to increase the volume by 1,000,000,000,000,000 cubic meters . A large dump truck holds about 10 cubic meters , so you would need about 100,000,000,000,000 dump trucks to do the job . It 's not going to happen . -LSB- Note : I did this pretty quickly and without any paper , so it 's certainly possible that I messed up the powers of ten , but I 'm pretty sure that if I did it wrong the correct numbers would lead to exactly the same conclusion . -RSB-</answer><suggestions>greenland/LOCATION antarctica/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1401949862000">Putting what Peg said another way , one of the largest open cut mines in the world is Mir in Russia It is 525m deep and 1200m in diameter and took 50 years to dig . The 10ft rise you are talking about would take the equivalent of almost 45 % of the entire Greenland/LOCATION ice sheet melting , given the dimensions of Greenland/LOCATION 's ice sheet compared to the size of Mir if you covered the entire surface of it 's ice sheet in mines the size of Mir you would get only roughly 25 % of it 's mass and that would mean digging 1666000 mines the size of Mir or around 300,000 to get nearer to the 45 % figure , maybe if you had a free weekend and a good tea spoon you could do this but only in the world of your pretend physics . So such a job could be done and in 50 years if you can find 1.66 million work teams the size of the one that dug Mir , or you could find one team and the job would take 83.3 million years , you choose . http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Mir_mine</answer><suggestions>russia/LOCATION greenland/LOCATION greenland/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402627195000">Its Carbon Dioxide ... Toxicity See also : Carbon dioxide poisoning Main symptoms of carbon dioxide toxicity , by increasing volume percent in air . -LSB- 83 -RSB- Carbon dioxide content in fresh air -LRB- averaged between sea-level and 10 kPa level , i.e. , about 30 km altitude -RRB- varies between 0.036 % -LRB- 360 ppm -RRB- and 0.039 % -LRB- 390 ppm -RRB- , depending on the location . -LSB- 84 -RSB- CO2 is an asphyxiant gas and not classified as toxic or harmful in accordance with Globally Harmonized System of Classification and Labelling of Chemicals standards of United/ORGANIZATION Nations/ORGANIZATION Economic/ORGANIZATION Commission/ORGANIZATION for Europe by using the OECD/ORGANIZATION Guidelines for the Testing of Chemicals . In concentrations up to 1 % -LRB- 10,000 ppm -RRB- , it will make some people feel drowsy . -LSB- 83 -RSB- Concentrations of 7 % to 10 % may cause suffocation , even in the presence of sufficient oxygen , manifesting as dizziness , headache , visual and hearing dysfunction , and unconsciousness within a few minutes to an hour . -LSB- 85 -RSB- The physiological effects of acute carbon dioxide exposure are grouped together under the term hypercapnia , a subset of asphyxiation . Because it is heavier than air , in locations where the gas seeps from the ground -LRB- due to sub-surface volcanic or geothermal activity -RRB- in relatively high concentrations , without the dispersing effects of wind , it can collect in sheltered\/pocketed locations below average ground level , causing animals located therein to be suffocated . Carrion feeders attracted to the carcasses are then also killed . Children have been killed in the same way near the city of Goma by CO 2 emissions from the nearby volcano Mt. Nyiragongo . -LSB- 86 -RSB- The Swahili term for this phenomenon is ` mazuku ' . Adaptation to increased levels of CO2 occurs in humans . Continuous inhalation of CO2 can be tolerated at three percent inspired concentrations for at least one month and four percent inspired concentrations for over a week . It was suggested -LSB- by whom ? -RSB- that 2.0 percent inspired concentrations could be used for closed air spaces -LRB- e.g. a submarine -RRB- since the adaptation is physiological and reversible . Decrement in performance or in normal physical activity does not happen at this level . -LSB- 87 -RSB- -LSB- 88 -RSB- However , it should be noted that submarines have carbon dioxide scrubbers which reduce a significant amount of the CO2 present . -LSB- 89 -RSB- Miners , who are particularly susceptible to gas exposure , referred to mixtures of carbon dioxide and nitrogen as `` blackdamp/ORGANIZATION , '' `` choke damp '' or `` stythe . '' Before more effective technologies were developed , miners would frequently monitor for dangerous levels of blackdamp and other gases in mine shafts by bringing a caged canary with them as they worked . The canary is more sensitive to environmental gases than humans , and as it became unconscious would stop singing and fall off its perch . The Davy lamp could also detect high levels of blackdamp/ORGANIZATION -LRB- which sinks , and collects near the floor -RRB- by burning less brightly , while methane , another suffocating gas and explosion risk , would make the lamp burn more brightly . Carbon dioxide differential above outdoor levels at steady state conditions -LRB- when the occupancy and ventilation system operation are sufficiently long that CO2 concentration has stabilized -RRB- are sometimes used to estimate ventilation rates per person . CO2 is considered to be a surrogate for human bio-effluents and may correlate with other indoor pollutants . Higher CO2 concentrations are associated with occupant health , comfort and performance degradation . ASHRAE Standard 62.1 -- 2007 ventilation rates may result in indoor levels up to 2,100 ppm above ambient outdoor conditions . Thus if the outdoor ambient is 400 ppm , indoor levels may reach 2,500 ppm with ventilation rates that meet this industry consensus standard . Levels in poorly ventilated spaces can be found even higher than this -LRB- range of 3,000 or 4,000 -RRB- . so ... no</answer><suggestions>united/ORGANIZATION nations/ORGANIZATION economic/ORGANIZATION commission/ORGANIZATION for/ORGANIZATION europe/ORGANIZATION oecd/ORGANIZATION goma/LOCATION blackdamp/LOCATION</suggestions>

The reason why CO2 pollution is bad is that it 's from burning hydrocarbons that have been sequestered outside our environment for millions of years , combining it with the oxygen in our environment to form CO2 .

	<title>I hear noises outside of my apartment at night , what should I do ?</title><suggestions></suggestions>
	<content>I live in an apartment building in Virginia/LOCATION , and often go outside at night -LRB- sometimes late night\/early morning -RRB- to smoke cigarettes . Recently , I have been hearing noises in the woods nearby ; they sound like a predator surveying their surroundings . The noises have become more abrupt and on occasion come very close to me -LRB- 50-100 feet -RRB- . I have ran on several occasions back to the building where I am due to the presence of coyotes in the area . I know of at least one group of coyotes within a 20 mile radius that have `` had their cubs killed '' ; so I am told . I have also seen a fox in the nearby field . I have contacted animal control about the situation , but am afraid of what to do during the day when I am leaving and arriving at the building . Does anyone have any advice on how to prevent an animal attack or if what I am hearing is the sound a dangerous animal is making ? Lastly , there was an incident around 8 months ago where a cat made a loud screeching noise . I noticed a cat bed missing the next month from a neighbors apartment . This is what worried me the most ; having dealt with dangerous and possibly rabid animals in the past , I know how violent they can become . And , I may not survive if I am outside by myself and a group of 5 coyotes approaches me . In case animal control does not notice anything , I will refrain from going outside at night to smoke . But , I am still worried about what is occurring outside .</content><suggestions>virginia/LOCATION</suggestions>

That is why you ca n't use just your weather to determine what is going on globally . The air did not `` get cold '' where you live , cold air from the Arctic moved in and stayed , due to the jet stream . You have confused the flow of weather with average global temperature . I know it is surprising to people who were buried under highly unusual blizzards all winter , but for all of the Northern Hemisphere that average temperature over land in January was about 1\/3 a degree warmer than the 30 year average . -LRB- 1\/3 of a degree does not sound like much , but over such a broad area it is indeed very much warmer . -RRB-</answer><suggestions>northern/LOCATION hemisphere/LOCATION jimz/PERSON u.s./LOCATION u.s./LOCATION alaska/LOCATION west/LOCATION u.s./LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402592365000">It 's based on environmentalist climate science instead of `` normal '' climate science . Environmental climate science is extremely biased and has always shown an extremists viewpoint on how the Earth 's climate actually works . Someday they may try and change the names of all of the colors in the spectrum . Ask any alarmists `` what the actual temperature of the Earth is '' and they will always use anomalies which are averages of averages of averages over time . These measurements are constructed from individual measurements at specific points in time , but not taken at the same time . A medical doctor would take 1 measurement to establish your temperature , but even that is misleading as to your actual average body temperature . It is impossible to measure the `` actual '' temperature of the Planet . They would have to take hundreds of millions of measurements at the same exact time to have any resemblance of an `` accurate '' average global temperature and that is simply impossible to do at this point in time . We know that temperatures can change from cold to warm to cold by 116 degrees F in a matter of 2 hours : http:\/\/www.blackhillsweather.com\/chinook.html '' ... At about 7:30 am MST , the temperature in Spearfish was -4 degrees Fahrenheit . The chinook kicked in , and two minutes later the temperature was 45 degrees above zero . The 49 degree rise in two minutes set a world record that is still on the books . By 9:00 am , the temperature had risen to 54 degrees . Suddenly , the chinook died down and the temperature tumbled back to -4 degrees . The 58 degree drop took only 27 minutes . The chinook was also doing strange things to the Rapid City temperature that same day . Around 10:30 am , the thermometer recorded a temperature jump from 20 degrees to 56 degrees in 5 minutes , a 36 degree rise . Around noon , the temperature plummeted 47 degrees in 5 minutes from 60 to 13 above zero . About a half hour later , a 35 degree rise took place when the reading went from 15 to 50 degrees , and another precipitous drop transpired about 2:20 pm when the temperature fell 41 degrees from 58 to 17 above . ... Predicting the exact time and extent of a chinook event is next to impossible during a Black Hills winter . While meteorologists may strongly suspect that chinook conditions will take place , pinpointing which portion of the forecast area will experience the event and how much the temperature will rise in a certain time frame is as much a matter of educated guesswork as anything else . ... '' They try and confuse the issue by saying weather is n't the climate , but the simple fact of the matter is that the climate is the result of all weather conditions over time . It seems that these environmental zealots can identify `` climate '' in 30 year time frames which is a shallow viewpoint , considering they identify the steep warming -LRB- through temperature anomalies - `` averages of averages of averages '' -RRB- in the most recent 30 year time period as `` evidence '' to promote their `` environmental and political cause '' . There have been 78 identifiable temperature shifts -LRB- climate changes -RRB- in the last 4500 years . I wonder how much information they simply `` throw out '' based on their own `` empirical arrogance '' to draw a conclusion that `` fits best '' to their selfish and self-important theories ?</answer><suggestions>spearfish/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402736473000">Well , to answer that question , you need to look at how scientists are trained . Students choose an undergraduate degree and will study their respective subjects for 3-4 years . Senior academics will have some research project they are working on , and will look to fill a number of post-graduate positions . Graduates will apply for those , and the senior academic will chose who they want . Usually it is only students who obtained a good final grade in their degree who are eligible for graduate research . Once the student joins the research project , they will spend much of their first year doing a literature survey , trying to grab all the material out there relevant to that project . They will conduct research under the supervision of that senior academic for a total of 3 - 5 years . During that time , most universities expect that the student will publish at least one or two papers that have been accepted in a peer-reviewed journal . They write up a PhD thesis which is sent to external examiners working in that field to read . They then have a defense or viva in which they must answer questions on that thesis . It 's usually several hours of fairly intensive , technical , grilling . Once that process is complete , the student will have to respond to any issues that arose . These can be things like minor corrections , or additional experiments that need to be completed . Some students never complete their PhD , others go on to be awarded one . The PhD is a qualification that indicates the individual is capable of conducting independent research . Those who wish to remain in academia will subsequently apply for post-doctoral research positions . These are really ` partnerships ' with more senior academics and post-docs help guide the research direction , apply for funding , and write papers . Usually people will spend several years hopping from one institution to the next , building up experience and papers . Eventually they 'll start to apply for academic positions . They 'll enter the university system as a junior lecturer , be responsible for finding research funding , and will lecturer to undergraduate classes . Over time , if they are kept on , they may be offered a tenured position which secures their job . Now , the point of all this is simple . Most scientists will be at a stage where a tenured position is achievable in their 30s . After that , they are independent and paid . At that stage in their career , it does n't matter what they publish , they 're tenured . They will receive a salary from the institution . The process of tenure is essential to academic freedom because , at that point , there is no reason for any scientist to follow ` consensus ' . Whether a tenured climatologists agrees or disagrees with AGW makes no difference to their pay . So , no is the answer to your question . Once a scientist reaches a tenured position within a university , you can not fire them for their academic conclusions . That 's the whole point of tenure .</answer><suggestions>academia/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<content>there are two petrol stations near my place , one with regular fuel and the other with 10 % ethanol blend , they both cost the same . Which one is better for the motorcycles engine , milage etc and why ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403771354000">The ethanol is worse , it will give you less mileage , and also can damage your tank\/engine if left in for a long time , they even now sell additives to reduce the damage .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403787637000">While ethanol will tend to work better in a high performance engine due to its higher octane rating it contains about 1\/3 less energy and will reduce mileage . If you do n't need a higher octane level and the fuels are equal in all other respects the regular would be a better value .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403837440000">Worse . First , although new cars have been required to tolerate up to 15 % ethanol since the 1980 's , the same can not be said about motorcycles , scooters and small gasoline appliances therefore natural rubber hoses and seals which dissolve in ethanol and metals such as brass and iron without nickel content or plating could be exposed to the fuel path . Plus any engine without fuel injection have carburetors that are bored for one fuel to air ratio and hence can not adjust to the different energy density of ethanol except by a manual choke which could be partially throttled . Of course , only the Premium Unleaded gasoline has 10 % ethanol as it was legislation passed by the government to call E10 , Premium Unleaded after the reputation E15 introduced as gasohol during the 70 's created the belief that ethanol would harm your engine .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403010012000">I have n't looked at your link . How often do you think the same piece of road gets dug up ? Maybe if it were guaranteed -LRB- as best it could be -RRB- that the road would be laid and remain undisturbed for 10 years , this might be a practical idea . The problem would then be storing that power . Do we have batteries good enough and long-lived enough to handle the charge\/discharge cycle - and then pour that stored power to the national grid where and when it was required . These solar cells generate power from Dawn to Sunset . Let 's say the biggest requirement for energy is at breakfast ; lunch and dinner times - 7am ; 12pm and 6pm respectively , it 's the hours between these peaks where energy would need to be stored . Obviously the hours between sunset and dawn would have a requirement that would need to be met from stored battery power . Aside from the R&D needed for solar panels which could be incorporated into not just roads , but walls ; windows ; roofs ; pavements ; street furniture ; etc , there would need to be a lot of research into batteries - coz we 're not there yet . There are batteries which have a charge\/discharge cycle in the thousands - but we REALLY need batteries that are capable of doing this reliably and repeatably hundreds of thousands of times before they need to be replaced and recycled</answer><suggestions>r/ORGANIZATION&/ORGANIZATIONd/ORGANIZATION coz/PERSON</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403030875000">It sounds like an interesting idea , but it would face immense problems . First off , the panels would probably suffer from very low efficiency . They wo n't be facing the sun at all times -LRB- something quite important -RRB- and they will likely be under some protective layer that would need to be thick and tough enough to resist damage . Consider how tough asphalt needs to be . Dust and dirt on the road would be another , similar problem . Most of the power they manage to generate would probably be used by the LEDs themselves , in which case , what 's the point ? Secondly , consider what will happen when the panels become damaged -- blacked out panels all over the road are going to be an issue . There is also the prospect of theft to consider . Plus , I do n't think the -LSB- likely marginal -RSB- financial benefits accumulated over time from surplus energy is going to offset the very high cost of manufacturing , fitting and maintaining these things , particularly on a large scale , not to mention the cost of tearing up all our roads for conversion .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1403045458000">No . But covering all roofs with solar panels is . And I am pretty sure that will be largely done in less than 20 years .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403053520000">They would have to be as cheap as asphalt , cheaper in fact as existing roads would have to be resurfaced . Think about it , I-10 in Houston/LOCATION was expanded to 24 lanes at a cost of 160 million per mile , even a small percentage increase on that would break the bank or rather taxpayers pocket . Then there 's the transportation costs of the electricity , conductors would have to be laid down and being in the ground would mean capacitance losses to the Earth itself There are efforts to make solar paint but solar roads are not practical . Solar energy typically peaks between noon and 4 pm but peak usage tends to be 4 pm to 8 pm . The whole idea of grid tied solar only works if solar is not the maajority of the power producers , indeed it has to be quite the minority producer for it to work , like wind power , it is best considered for base load only and only partial base load at that . If you are in an area with a lot of hydro dams where you could pump the water back up to the reservoir to reclaim later then solar and wind are practical but reservoirs often have to be depleted so they can prevent floods so even hydro is not an effective counter balance . There is a new technology called cube cell which stores electricity in the valence shells of Vanadium in an electrolyte that can be then stored in tanks till needed but Vanadium is a rare earth metal and is n't available in large quantities . Hawaii/LOCATION is already seeing this problem as everyone there wants to have grid tied solar but if everyone is solar then who will use the excess power during sunny hours and what would provide the power when it is n't sunny . The utilities in Hawaii/LOCATION are already turning down netmetering applications and considering the purchase of cube cells . To implement more solar and wind , we need load following generation . Coal is not load following , it takes 12 hours to change the output of a coal plant . Conventional Nuclear is not load following , it also takes 12 hours to adjust power output plus there is balancing the Xenon decay to account for . Natural gas is almost load following as it takes minutes to adjust the output . Hydro is pretty much the closest we have to load following . We basically load follow by trade between generating plants on the grid thereby minimizing the excess power generation needed . If we want solar and wind power , we have to deploy Liquid Fluoride Thorium Reactors which by the laws of physics is load following .</answer><suggestions>houston/LOCATION valence/LOCATION hawaii/LOCATION hawaii/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<content>If carbon monoxide formed in hot engines of vehicles are burned away at high temperatures , this can reduce carbon monoxide emission from car engines . But why is this not done to reduce carbon monoxide pollution ?</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1403114663000">CO , carbon monoxide , is formed not because temperatures are not high enough , but because there is not enough oxygen to oxidize all of the carbon that is being burned . You can make the temperature as high as you like -- if there is n't enough oxygen , then CO will be a result of that combustion . While engine manufacturers try to get the correct balance between gasoline and air\/oxygen , it only has to be off a little to create CO. . That 's why all cars today have catalytic converters .

	<answer epoch="1403197944000">Do you know how much Carbon monoxide is in the air ? ZERO !! http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Atmosphere_of_Earth#Composition There is a reason for this . Carbon monoxide is an unstable molecule . It becomes Carbon Dioxide almost the moment it gets outside the tailpipe because it immediately ` grabs ' an oxygen atom . This is why carbon monoxide will kill you in a closed environment , the carbon monoxide takes the free oxygen out of the air . Also carbon monoxide binds very strongly to the iron in the hemoglobin in the blood . So if you breath in carbon monoxide , it sticks to your hemoglobin and takes up all of the oxygen binding sites and your blood loses all of its ability to transport oxygen , and you suffocate . But in open air it 's not a danger unless you are sniffing the tailpipe . -----------------------</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

Yet when we compare the efficiency of photosynthesis at converting light to energy -LRB- 1 % -RRB- compared to even our poor PV solar cells -LRB- 10 to 22 % -RRB- this does not seem to be the case . But I only see engineering . Our engineering during the industrial revolution has brought many marvels but also the unintended consequence of pollution and waste . Bioengineering is not without its own potential hazards . We already know that transplanting plants and animals from one environment to a different one can allow it to become an invasive species . We also know that genetically engineered organisms tend to become the dominant species in the wild . A terminator gene has also been manufactured that makes plants grown from supplied seeds unable to reproduce . We therefore have all but one element for a sci fy horror story . It would only take the terminator gene to slip one generation before bio-engineered organisms that escape into the wild to become dominant and slowly sterilize all plants on earth . Without plants , without photosynthesis all animals would die . Bioengineering could be the prescription for our own demise . But that is the horror story . The reality could be worse or more subtle . We already have a good start as GMO are not allowed to be labeled as such in the US . Will we replace Terrafugia with big bird ? Not in the near future but someday with a continued lack of oversight and similar mistakes to what is done in mechanical engineering .</answer><suggestions>earth/LOCATION gmo/ORGANIZATION us/LOCATION</suggestions>

	<answer epoch="1402162471000">Stubby , I 'm sure you 've observed that deniers will believe anything that could in some way be used to bolster their argument . Conversely of course , they systematically reject anything that opposes it . Take for example the temperature records . If they show warming then it 's rejected out of hand -- the data are fudged , readings are unreliable , stations are poorly located etc. . If it shows a levelling of temps then it 's accepted without question . Similarly , scientists publish data showing ice is being lost from Antarctica/LOCATION faster then before. , it instantly gets rejected for any number of reasons . If on the other hand , a politician with no scientific experience at all , states that Antarctica/LOCATION is growing then this too will be blindly accepted as fact . Whether it 's Limbaugh the Koch/ORGANIZATION Brothers/ORGANIZATION or anyone else is really of no consequence , as long as they say that climate change is n't happening or it 's exaggerated or it 's beneficial etc then it 's good enough for the deniers . All too often the familiar cry from the deniers is that anyone supporting the tenets of climate change is lying . It 's the easiest cop out as it requires absolutely no contrary evidence . If deniers had evidence they 're produce it , instead there 's a reversion to unfounded accusations and name-calling . A true sceptic would listen to what was being said , absorb and comprehend it , then provide a rational and considered counter argument backed up with reliable evidence .

	<answer epoch="1402459180000">The process of fabricating conventional single - and polycrystalline silicon PV cells begins with very pure semiconductor-grade polysilicon - a material processed from quartz and used extensively throughout the electronics industry . The polysilicon is then heated to melting temperature , and trace amounts of boron are added to the melt to create a P-type semiconductor material . Next , an ingot , or block of silicon is formed , commonly using one of two methods : 1 -RRB- by growing a pure crystalline silicon ingot from a seed crystal drawn from the molten polysilicon or 2 -RRB- by casting the molten polysilicon in a block , creating a polycrystalline silicon material . Individual wafers are then sliced from the ingots using wire saws and then subjected to a surface etching process . After the wafers are cleaned , they are placed in a phosphorus diffusion furnace , creating a thin N-type semiconductor layer around the entire outer surface of the cell . Next , an anti-reflective coating is applied to the top surface of the cell , and electrical contacts are imprinted on the top -LRB- negative -RRB- surface of the cell . An aluminized conductive material is deposited on the back -LRB- positive -RRB- surface of each cell , restoring the P-type properties of the back surface by displacing the diffused phosphorus layer . Each cell is then electrically tested , sorted based on current output , and electrically connected to other cells to form cell circuits for assembly in PV modules .</answer><suggestions></suggestions>

	<content>My new table lamp states maximum if 60w and if using low energy bulb , maximum is 12w . Can I fit a spiral low energy 20w bulb equivalent to 75w ? Many thanks</content><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402158697000">No</answer><suggestions></suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402159182000">Yes it is safe to use a 12 watt low energy bulb that has a 75 watt equivalent rating in a lamp with a label saying to use no more than 60 watt bulbs . The equivalent watt is really a meaningless rating , used more for marketing purposes to say how bright it will appear . Only the actual watts used matters when deciding on the largest bulb that is safe to use in a lamp . The reason there is a power limit is not that it would overload the electric circuit , but that it would get too hot and be a fire hazard . An incandescent bulb makes more heat than it does light , and all the extra watts end up as extra heat . So the 12 watt -LRB- actual -RRB- 75 watt -LRB- equivalent -RRB- bulb will be much cooler than a 75 watt incandescent bulb that produces the same amount of light . You can easily learn this by touching the bulb . The 12w CFL or LED bulb will be warm but not burn you , while a 75 watt incandescent will badly burn you if you touch it -LRB- only when it is on of course -RRB- .</answer><suggestions>watt/PERSON watt/PERSON</suggestions>
	<answer epoch="1402233339000">Yes you can lamp rating 60watt maximum so u can not use any bulb or -LRB- load -RRB- that exceeds 60watt mark . So u can use any bulb that is under 60 watts range and have the same voltage range as your table lamp specify . bec mostly table lamps works on 12v DC -LRB- direct current -RRB- they have a step down transformer that converts 220v or 110v AC to 12v AC then a diode converts 12v ac to dc . just check voltage rating and socket size and buy any bulb that is under 60watt it will work fine . It could be 10w , 15w , 20w or upto 65w and could have any equivalent rating . As ppl already said this is a marketing strategies 20w bulb equivalent to 75watt they are compairing the luminous of each bulb or light production compair to their power .

	<answer epoch="1402188979000">More than you can afford . A typical US/LOCATION household AC takes at least 6 kw to run , you 're talking about half of that capacity . Although you may have sunlight for 12 hours , unless you have tracking motors to aim your solar panels , you 're really only talking about 6 hours of usable sunshine in sunny climates , 4 hours or less further from the equator -LRB- you need to look up solar insolation hours of sunlight for your area but the US ranges from 6 hours along the southern states to 4 hours in the northern states and 2 hours in Alaska/LOCATION . If you are talking about a 80 % duty cycle -LRB- the higher , the better sized the AC is -RRB- , you 're talking about generating 74 kwh in just 6 hours therefore you would need 12,400 watts . Now if you are using lead acid batteries which are only 50 % efficient at charging and 95 % efficient at discharging , you 're talking about 26,105 watts in panels which at $ 3 a watt would mean roughly $ 78,315 US just for the panels never mind the charge controller , or the batteries . This is also omitting the inefficiencies of the inverter on the basis that you could get a DC motor driven compression AC .</answer><suggestions>us/LOCATION alaska/LOCATION ac/ORGANIZATION</suggestions>
